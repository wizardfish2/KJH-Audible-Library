Luckily, an alien named Crish arrived to help Zander adjust to his new reality.</p> <p>His first few days were a chaotic mess as he tried to adapt, but it was his first day on board the ship <i>Fractured Dreams</i> that Zander discovered what his new life would be. He was one of the lucky one-in-ten-thousand: a person whose body accepted an AI of Antecedent technology. His AI, however, was special, taking on the memories and persona of his former lover, Selda Engel.</p> <p>With Crish's and AI Selda's help, Zander came up with a mad plan to displace the pilot leader, Shivatin the Rakshasa, and take over that position. He had experience staying alive as a mercenary and used that to forge the fractured crew into a cohesive new whole.</p> <p>As he was finally taking on the mantle of leader, Shivatin led a mutiny to take the ship from the captain and to kill Zander. The Rakshasa had no clue what he'd unleashed in doing so; Zander led his new team in a repelling action, killing the invading boarders, then pushing on to the bridge to take out Shivatin.</p> <p>Veldiami, the captain of <i>Fractured Dreams</i>, took it one step further, boarding the other ship that helped in the mutiny to claim as salvage. It only took killing four—including the ship's captain—to secure it as loot.</p> <p>Left on the other ship, the <i>Righteous</i>, to guide it to the nearest galactic hub, Zander made a deal with the remaining crew. They used the FTL drive to reach the hub that day, meaning Zander would find himself alone on MX Hub for two days before <i>Fractured Dreams</i> and her crew arrived.</p> <p>What trouble could a human—completely out of his depth in a new universe <i>and </i>on an alien space station—get into before his crewmates arrived?</p>";
