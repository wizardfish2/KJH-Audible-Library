But when Cristy—a gnoll left orphaned by the attack—takes things into her own hands, a fierce war suddenly erupts at their doorstep.</p> <p>As the battle rages on, SJ makes another troubling discovery: the level cap around Killic has doubled, allowing overpowered Legionnaires, mighty wyverns, and mysterious assassins to stir up even more trouble in the once-idyllic starter town. Since she rejected the System's terms and conditions, strange trials have popped up all around her, but she's never faced such dangerous enemies before.</p> <p>Newly appointed to Killic's council, SJ must be equal parts diplomat and warrior. The fate of the town and her new companions depends on her shrewdness and grit. But she has her sights set higher than just survival . . . She'll do everything possible to wield the chaos to achieve glory.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG series—with more than 500,000 views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
