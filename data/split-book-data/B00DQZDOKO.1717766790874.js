The Nightstalkers are back, and the world needs them now more than ever. </p> <p>When a real-life truth serum, a military cabal bent on launching a preemptive strike against America’s enemies, and the nuclear football - which contains the information the President needs to launch the nation's missiles - all converge, the Nightstalkers suit up for another deadly mission. Joining forces with the Cellar, the covert world’s police force, the team might be mankind's last hope. </p> <p>A bombed-out neighborhood in Pakistan. A strip mall in suburban Virginia.
