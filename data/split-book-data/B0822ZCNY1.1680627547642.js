Their prospects seem dire...and yet, perhaps some power still remains within the veins of the clan. Dragons do not easily die, and neither do the dragonblooded.&nbsp;</p> <p>Come witness a new legend in the making. The legend of Linley Baruch.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the first of eight fantasy novels comprising the translation of the seminal 'Coiling Dragon Saga' by famous Chinese author Wo Chi Xi Hong Shi, originally hosted on www.wuxiaworld.com.
