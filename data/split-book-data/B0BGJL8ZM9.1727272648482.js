window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Before World War Two could reach its conclusion, the world suffered what could only be defined as a cataclysm.</p> <p>Legend has it that an experiment failed. Catastrophically so. And when it failed, the center of the United States, from the Sierra Nevada to the Mississippi river, became \"The Waste\", where everything changed.</p> <p>Except it didn't only happen in North America. In fact, it happened all around the world.</p> <p>Few places were spared, though, only a handful experienced it as deeply as the United States did.</p> <p>In the Wastes of the world, every fantasy creature, fairy tale demon, or mythological monster exists. From Orcs, to Neriads, Ogres, Trolls, Wraiths, Elves, Harpies, and even Beastmen. They all exist, and all despise humankind.</p> <p>For North America, in the shattered bones of the country, the West and East Coasts, new governments have rose, then fell.</p> <p>Vince has become the master of a major portion of the Wastes of North America. Responsible for everything and everyone inside his boundaries. There is little that doesn’t fall under his purview.</p> <p>Now, he has to take up a courier mission of sorts.</p> <p>Except he’s the item to be delivered.</p> <p>Straight to the European continent. </p> <p>Where Vince plans on delivering a massive helping of Yosemite to the masses.</p> <p>All while giving them a heavy taste of the Legion technology.</p> <p>A job that’ll change the lives of everyone where he lands as well as where he came from.</p>";
