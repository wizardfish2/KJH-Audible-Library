Fortunately, such violence breeds opportunity. Allies, knowledge, magical items, and the promise of a cold pint can all be found here, should the tribe succeed.</p> <p>Yet beyond this, shadows stir. A growing, necrotic sea that threatens to engulf the tribe and put an end to their plans almost as soon as they have formed. Whether they know it or not.</p>";
