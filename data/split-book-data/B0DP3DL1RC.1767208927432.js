Again.</b></p> <p>This time it's the mysterious group of bald baddies allied with Darrin Redthorn, who's been busy stripping magical metal out of the Earth. Double trouble.</p> <p>Darrin is no more, courtesy of the bald baddies. They're eager to send our favorite witch to the same fate. They have their reasons.</p> <p>Maybe it's because Scarlett is hot on the trail of missing college students in Provo, Utah, and all signs point to the bald men with wands as the culprits. Some bad guys don't know when to give up.</p> <p><b>Fortunately, the magicals in Provo have Scarlett's back. The Witches on Wheels have even become her extended family. Snow, Maddox, and the rest of the Spell Riders are ready to roll into action at the tip of a wand.</b></p> <p>Unlocking Scarlett's magical pendant may give her additional power. She'll need every drop, alongside whatever magical weapons and gadgets her allies can supply.</p> <p>This enemy is stronger than any she's yet faced. They can control minds, and who knows what else? <i>Only one way to find out.</i></p>";
