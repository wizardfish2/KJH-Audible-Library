He needs an Avatar.</p> <p>Achieving this lofty aim will require sacrifice and hard work—for his followers, at least. So while Clive practices with his ethereal powers, they attempt to push their budding god up through the Ethereal Stages and bring him back to the world of the living.</p> <p>But doing so will change everything. Secrets will be revealed, hell will break loose, and chaos will rain on Falritas, causing a war that will reach every corner of the land and beyond.</p>";
