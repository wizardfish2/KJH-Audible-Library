But after a mission to infiltrate an enemy territory goes horribly wrong, he wakes up in the body of a spoiled noble mage from the very world he’s been taught to hate.</p> <p>Magic? He’s never touched it, and now everyone expects him to master it like a pro.</p> <p>Trying to survive in an elite magic academy surrounded by classmates who seem to know far more than he does, would be hard enough—yet Damien’s real identity as an assassin is the least of his problems. Between botched spells, awkward encounters, and people calling him by a name that isn’t his, surviving magic school might actually be more dangerous than his old job.</p> <p>Can Damien bluff his way through magic class, deal with aristocratic drama, and keep his secret from getting out? Or will he set a new record for the worst student ever?</p>";
