window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Wrangler. Tamer. Healer. Builder of the world’s first All-Monster Sanctuary.</b></p> <p>Jack Wilder’s a big animal vet, a wildlife wrangler, and a man with a huge heart. His passions take him through Asia, Africa, and all points in between to rescue endangered species or heal creatures who’d be happy to repay the favor with a fanged bite.</p> <p>His life gets an unexpected upgrade when he’s brought to Navishala, a fantasy world of mountains, high-altitude forests, and more sentient species than you can shake a sword at. It’s a world that needs someone who can wrangle dragonkin, rescue trapped pegasus foals, or save the odd cattle ranch from a monster rampage.</p> <p>It’s a life of danger, unexpected challenges, and romance. His expertise is valuable, and his plans to build an All-Monster Sanctuary might make him an even bigger target. Luckily, there are women as strong as him in this world, and they’re ready to both protect and share him.</p>";
