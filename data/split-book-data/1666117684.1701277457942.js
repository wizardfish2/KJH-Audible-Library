window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>To Angus, things couldn't be more perfect. Sure, he still has to deal with an aging body in the outside world that won't allow him to do much.... But he's found solace in Alterwelt, a virtual world where he can craft to his heart's content and indulge in his life's true passion. Spending his time between fulfilling orders and expanding his ever-growing smithing guild, Hephaestus is living the dream, so to speak.</p> <p>But maybe, just maybe, things were a little too perfect.</p> <p>As he'll quickly learn, there's a growing movement gaining traction in the real world; Moralizers who denounce all the violence and depravity that pervade virtual worlds. Their demands are simple: They want the \"games\" neutered; they want Alterwelt and other Imperium spaces strictly regulated, which could threaten the world Angus has come to call his home.</p> <p>Behind the movement stands one familiar foe: Lord Liberath, the same individual Hephaestus had managed to oust when the blacksmith had been accused of item hacking.</p>";
