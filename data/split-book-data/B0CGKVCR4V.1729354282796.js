window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An age has passed, a blight curses the land, and one hero stands above the rest to restore the balance.</p> <p>Verdan Blacke is an Imperial Wizard, a researcher by preference but soldier by necessity. Surviving an intense battle, Verdan is cursed by a hex witch in her final moments. Without any good options, Verdan escapes the ever-increasing pain the curse inflicts by performing a self-made stasis ritual.</p> <p>When the spell fades, and he has awoken, Verdan finds a world completely different from the one he left behind. Dark things work in daylight with impunity, once common knowledge is a mystery, and even the nature of magic that humans use has changed.</p> <p>One wizard, a million problems, and the wrath of profound magic.</p>";
