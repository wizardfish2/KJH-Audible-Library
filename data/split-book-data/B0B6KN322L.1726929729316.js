window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Marc's Safe Zone, and his network of interconnected Safe Zones, has been upgraded to an Industrial Technology level. With the new tech level comes a number of items that they've desperately wanted to build. Now railways, lighter than air travel, primitive firearms, and more are available, once the requirements for their tech chains are satisfied.</p> <p>Marc has finally managed to get the day to day running of the Safe Zone out of his own hands and into hands he trusts. His mother is fully into the administrative end of things and his father, while head of the defenses, has now been granted build access on the pedestal so Marc is free to explore and grind for levels.</p> <p>With the System trying to bypass its restrictions, the elves building a new settlement in Marc's Captured lands, and what seems like a major quest that needs doing, Marc's been slowed, if not totally stalled, on the expansion of both his Safe Zone and the network of Safe Zones that allow him to Capture land. Fortunately, the lighter than air tech chain offers a number of benefits, including the ability to search the surrounding areas and track down other survivors in their own Safe Zones.</p>";
