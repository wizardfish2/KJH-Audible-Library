Sure, it's a rundown mansion in the middle of nowhere... but that makes it the perfect place for my magical lair. Ever since the System came to Earth I've aspired to be a powerful wizard!</p> <p>Of course, difficulties crop up. I’ve got to learn to master my new magic, pay down my mortgage, and raise money for the manor’s repair. There’s also dealing with my creepy neighbors, escaping murderous ghosts, and preventing a blood ritual that could spell the end of the world.</p> <p>With my beautiful familiar, a stacked Drow blacksmith, and a cunning Arachne scholar by my side, there's no way monsters, sagging ceilings, or blood rituals are going to get in the way of my dream.</p> <p>Paying the bills and avoiding the apocalypse can’t be that hard, right?</p>";
