window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains books three and four of Time Wars Last Forever. </b></p> <p><i>Fragmented Time </i>(book three)</p> <p>Time is tearing apart. The Earth and every soul on it are not just gone; they never even existed. Jon Ryan's hopes of pulling off yet another miracle are evaporating like drops of rain on hot desert sands. His improbable team that has to work together by all rights should have no chance of doing so. There's an astronomer forced to become the reluctant commander-in-chief. A young academic must captain a cantankerous alien ship that is Jon's only shot at victory. A college student who communes with the dead learns she is mysteriously the key to any potential success. And Sapale is a held prisoner by the most arrogant and malevolent race of time masters imaginable.</p> <p>Somewhere in time and space hides the last time ship of the alien clan that began the time war, commanded by a stark-raving lunatic. If our heroes can find and destroy that threat, there is no way they can proceed with their mission of reanimating the lost Earth. Oh boy.</p> <p><i>Shattered Time</i> (book four)</p> <p>Time has not been kind to Jon Ryan. It almost seems personal between the two of them. His mission to resurrect a lost Earth gets more complicated, more dangerous, and less likely to succeed with each new barrier thrown in his path.</p> <p>No sooner does he escape from the master time lords than he learns Sapale is now those mastersâ€™ prisoner. And she's taken the only vessel that can make the journey 17 galaxies away, so he's helpless to rescue her. Jon faces the least attractive choice in his very long life. In order to make Sapale's rescue even possible, he must do something he cannot stomach. He has to disrupt his own timeline and dig up the advanced alien spacecraft named <i>Wrath</i>.</p> <p>The only entity in the universe that might know how to save the Earth is Time itself. But Time has hidden itself away, never to be found. What comes after hopeless? Whatever that is, Jon and his crew are about to find out.</p>";
