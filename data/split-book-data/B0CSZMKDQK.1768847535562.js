Bounty hunters, vengeful enemies, and near-omnipotent Nobles have hounded her through the Collective. She's avoided them when she could and tried to convince them to leave her be when she couldn't. With the Fleet seeking her, intending to steal her hard-earned levels and rob her of her accomplishments, though, that's no longer an option.</p> <p>Benning is tired of running. The Stellar Corsair is done following the Collective's laws and rules. She'll make her hunters fear her name, one way or the other, no matter what it takes or who has to suffer in the process.</p> <p>Faced with enemies both without and within, with even the all-powerful System standing against her, Benning will need every skill and talent she has, every ounce of her astonishing will just to survive. Can she make even the System itself fear the Drone Marauder?</p>";
