But when she shows him the inner workings of the Paladin Nation, he discovers why. </p> <p>Paladins traverse the planet through wormholes to keep the world safe, but from what, they won't say. Although his parents were not actually one of them, Socket is different. He soon finds himself in the center of controversy and betrayal when he's anointed the Paladin Nation's prodigy.

He's trying to live two lives: one as a superhero while hanging onto his normal life. </p> <p>While fearlessly dealing with his masochistic trainer, he's trying to salvage his deteriorating relationship with his girlfriend back home. </p>";
