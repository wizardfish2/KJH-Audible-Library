Simple, huh?</b></p> <p>The vast comet should have destroyed us....</p> <p>When it slowed, then landed, everything we thought we knew about the universe changed. And for Mark, things just got far stranger and much more dangerous.</p> <p>They came from another dimension, condemning our selfish, greedy ways but sensing in us a potential to change. So when they chose Mark as a volunteer in their deadly trials to save the human race, how could he say no?</p> <p>Join him on his quest for loot, levels, and powerful abilities. He'll need them all as he fights in kingdoms large and small, battling demons and dinosaurs, vampires and robots, orcs and...fairies?</p> <p>For Mark, the price of saving the planet looks to be a world of hurt. Maybe he would've been better off if the comet hadn't landed so softly, after all?</p> <p><b>Don't miss the beginning of this new LitRPG series that promises a mix of action and adventure, swords and sorcery, and a sprinkling of dark humor.</b></p>";
