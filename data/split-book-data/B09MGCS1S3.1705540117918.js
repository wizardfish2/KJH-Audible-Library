window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Join supernatural agent Eddie Drood on a dangerous adventure in the second Secret Histories novel from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Simon R. Green.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“Fans of fast-paced heroics, featuring a snarky knight armored in silver and sarcasm, need look no further; Eddie Drood is your guy.” (SF Revu)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>For centuries, the Droods have been fighting the monsters in the shadows so that the rest of you lot can go about your everyday lives. These days, I’m the head of the family, and it’s fallen to me to deal with a bit of a mess left over from World War II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Seems that back then the Droods made a pact with a bunch of demons known as the Loathly Ones to fight some really nasty buggers called up by the Nazis. Once the war was over, we couldn’t get rid of them. Now they’re calling their masters to invade and destroy our world...and we Droods are the last, best hope of stopping them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>I’d say that the world is in a major lot of trouble.</p>";
