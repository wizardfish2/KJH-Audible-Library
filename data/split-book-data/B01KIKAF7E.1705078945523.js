window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cass Clereaux likes her job. It's simple - steal the magic, don't get killed. FireSouls like her are perfect for magic treasure hunting. Their dragon soul helps them find treasure, their wicked powers help them steal it. But there's a big freaking downside - FireSouls are hunted. If either of the magical governments figures out what she is, she can kiss her life goodbye. </p> <p>When the Alpha Council comes to her with a special job, it's a no-brainer to turn it down, no matter how much money they're offering. Shifters who can sniff out her weird magic are the last supernaturals she needs to be around. Worse? They have a history of hunting FireSouls. But when Cass learns that a little girl's life is at stake and Cass is her last hope, she doesn't have a choice. </p> <p>With her sisters and the powerful Shifter Aidan Merrick at her back, she's got a chance at saving the girl and keeping her deadly secret - until she learns there's far more to this kidnapping than meets the eye. </p>";
