His time is spent struggling to restore the city with his people, yet trouble brews on the horizon. The Archon has not sat idle while Felix consolidated his power, and the ancient seals upon his prison have been broken.</p> <p>Guided by a Territorial Quest, Felix and his allies find themselves in the unenviable position of needing to split their forces as the drums of war resume.
