window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mythological artifacts become a modern arsenal in a millennia-long interstellar battle. On one side stands the alien race that styled itself as gods to secretly steer human evolution. On the other is an elite team of Area 51 commandos, dedicated to freeing humanity from their interstellar overlords. </p> <p>Special Forces officer Mike Turcotte and his former lover Lisa Duncan are among the few who know the truth about the extraterrestrial threat - and have the power to fight it. But can they save the human race from eradication or just act as pawns in an elaborate plot to enslave the planet? </p> <p>Having just retrieved the legendary sword Excalibur - in actuality the control key to an alien mother ship - from atop Mount Everest, Turcotte rejoins the fight, intent on ending the ancient, bloody conflict once and for all. Yet even as he tries to avert a nuclear holocaust, a deadlier, more insidious alien foe hides in the shadows, waiting for the chance to alert its kind that Earth is ripe for conquest.</p>";
