Then there will be a show trial! A big fancy show trial with all of the media there as it's broadcast live across the entirety of the Democratic People's Republic of Solaria!</p> <p>While the outcome may be predetermined, it doesn't matter to Speaker Neill, he knows that Chase is a fraud, and the idea of destroying the little gutter snipe before the entire Republic makes him smile. Then, after he's done and the fake prince has been sentenced to death, Speaker Neill has a show planned for the Morgan pretender that the people will remember for a long time.</p> <p>Of course, Chase has other plans about how this trial is going to proceed, even if the ending is predetermined. One of those is to go down swinging while exposing Phillip for the stupid and vicious man that he really is.</p> <p>And maybe, just maybe, there are other people out there who have plans of their own as well...</p>";
