window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A sacrifice made. A Primordial defeated. The hard part starts now.</b></p> <p>Felix had risked everything to stop the threat of the Unending Maw. Except instead of death, he and his Companion Pit were transported to the deadly Void, a place far worse than the Foglands. The Maw is there with them, bonded somehow to Felix in a way none of them understand, but all of them hate. </p> <p>The three must navigate the desolate expanse of the dark Void, contending with voidbeasts, marauders, and the creeping influence of the Maw itself. It will take everything that Felix has—and more—merely to survive, let alone escape.</p> <p>All choices have consequences.</p>";
