window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Earth is an alien civilization’s experimental training ground, and Ethan is caught in the middle of it.</b></p> <p>The experiment’s final stage is here, an apocalyptic Swarm ravenous for biomass and Psy. Its arrival wakes a dormant extraterrestrial artifact that seizes Ethan and transforms him into something more than human.</p> <p><i>Phase Titan</i>—the title means nothing to Ethan or his scientist companion. But to the alien babe he finds fighting the local warlord the Titans are legendary warriors, a myth that she came to Earth chasing, and the only hope for stopping the Swarm.</p> <p>He has the tools to get it done—weapons that channel Psy, a bioengineered body unlike anything else on Earth, and an alien ship filled with cutting-edge technology. As strong as Ethan is, he can’t do it alone. He needs companions known as Harmonics to shape his Titan power and keep him sane as he carries a burden he never asked for.</p> <p>But before Ethan can save the world, he’ll have to survive. The local militia aren’t making it easy. They’ve found Ethan’s base, a secret government lab, and put it under siege.</p> <p>And worse lurks within the militia’s ranks than raiders looking for spoils—things that aren’t entirely human anymore. Things that only a Titan can stand toe to toe with. Luckily for Earth, Ethan is just the Titan for the job.</p>";
