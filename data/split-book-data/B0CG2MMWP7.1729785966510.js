But they cannot cut all the ties to their ancestral home, and the sufferings of its peoples. Besides, someone needs to hunt down those who intentionally opened Pandora's Box and punish them—with prejudice.</p> <p>The AI they found at the bottom of the Mariana Trench answered some important questions about the makers of the ancient spaceship, but it also revealed a primeval enemy of humanity. All the holy books warned us about it . . . but we didn't listen.</p> <p>Now, from the far reaches of space, something is coming . . . something intelligent, and deadly, and utterly ruthless.</p>";
