window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Book 3 of Guardian of Aster Fall.</b><br> <br> The Moonlight Relic sits high atop the Western Reaches, an ancient fortress against invasion from beyond. An age ago, its enchantments were designed to stabilize the dimensions and defend those who lived there, as well as to be a model for other relics of the same type. Not long after it was built, it was shattered in a cataclysmic war.<br> <br> Sam has inherited the only key to the relic that exists on Aster Fall. Now, he has to repair it before the Outsiders who destroyed it return. He also has to make Highfold safe for his family while threats rise on every side, including those that have nothing to do with Outsiders.<br> <br> Primordial enchantments, crafting, and battles await in the third volume of the epic series!</p>";
