With the Summer Knight injured, who better to step in and take his place protecting the royal family than Lazarus himself? </p> <p>In a land with no death, however, the Pale Horseman finds himself at an extreme disadvantage. With his powers limited, and the clock ticking as the ghoul virus ravages his body, Laz had better find the assassins and cure himself fast, or he's dead meat.</p>";
