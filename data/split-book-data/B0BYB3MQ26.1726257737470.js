window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>So I just got a call.</p> <p>Apparently my mom—yes, the same one who just came cannonballing back into my life a few weeks ago after ten years without a word—might have killed someone. A self-help guru. You know, one of those guys promising to SHIFT your life into overdrive with his magical secrets.</p> <p>\"Shift\" because those secrets come from a long lineage of shifters. Yeah, I don't get it either. Then again, I wasn't one of his loyal disciples, so I never paid much attention to his corny late night ads.</p> <p>But this guy getting murdered? That sure has my attention. Because if I don't figure out who killed him, my mom is going down for the crime. Although there's one thought that I can't shake from my mind as I sort through the mounting evidence: maybe she actually did it.</p> <p>And if that's the case, who the hell is this woman who's returned after all these years?</p>";
