Worse, the training instructor is an unhinged chief with a particular dislike for Jake.</p> <p>But Jake refuses to give up, refuses to wash out, because humanity is facing its greatest threat yet. If someone doesn’t step up, it could all be over for the human species.</p> <p>Contains the complete series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Powered</i></li> <li><i>Dynamo</i></li> <li><i>Meltdown</i></li> <li><i>Infliction</i></li> </ul>";
