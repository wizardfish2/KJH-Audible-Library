Max’s boss had scheduled a team-building exercise for survival training, so they had bags packed with camping gear, firearms, and ammunition.</p> <p>Then the aircraft hit a mysterious vortex in the air that pulled them inexorably toward the west at a dizzying speed. That vortex dumped their aircraft back in time in Northern Germany 1,700 years earlier.</p> <p>How are Max, the six remaining women from his flight, and the two orphans he rescued going to survive as they help their Saxon neighbors try to survive Frankish raids and the coming Roman army?</p>";
