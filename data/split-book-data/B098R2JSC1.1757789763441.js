As he grapples to understand his oddly fluctuating powers, a call from his trusted mechanic, Samir, is the last thing he needs. But the strange occurrences at the autobody shop can’t be ignored.</p> <p>Calling on Nixie - and a rather odd gift from a water witch clan - Damian uncovers a dreadful creature haunting Samir’s shop. Knowing he can’t face a basilisk in his current state, his only option is to seek out Gaia in his quest for answers.</p> <p>Yet as destruction closes in on St. Louis, the only hope of salvation could be the ghost of an Utukku...one who is downright cranky about being dead.</p>";
