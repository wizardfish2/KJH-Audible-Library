Now he must face it.</b> </p> <p>When postal worker Martin Briar is invited to partake in a secret time travel opportunity, he jumps at the chance to leave his dull life and step into the past. But he also has his own motivation for going back in time: the disappearance of his 12-year-old daughter two decades ago. </p> <p>Traveling to Denver in 1996 to investigate, he finds the world brimming with a different vibe: fewer skyscrapers, laid back people, a return to the life he once knew - a city on the verge of explosive growth.
