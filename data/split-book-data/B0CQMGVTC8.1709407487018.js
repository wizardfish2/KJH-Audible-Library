window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The long-awaited sequel to Jake’s Magical Market is finally here—and now with more market!</b></p> <p>Well, not quite yet. First, Jake has to survive a perilous trek through time if he ever hopes to return home to his friends, his market, and his former world. The last time we saw our intrepid hero, Jake had barely managed to escape being trapped on a dead version of his own world. Using a combination of his new powers, he threw himself backward through time, back to when the god that trapped him first rose to power. There, Jake snatched divinity from the hands of the ascending god, consuming it for himself without any regard for the consequences of his actions. In a surprise twist, such a poorly thought-out plan came with some serious downsides! Now Jake has a big target painted on his back. The jealous gods of this world are hungry for divine power and not afraid to kill another god to get it. Stuck in the past, Jake must learn to navigate a world full of desperate gods, wild monsters, bizarre powers, and weird “cultivating” mortals who claim they can become just as powerful as the gods themselves—as long as they get to sit around contemplating the mysteries of the universe for a few hundred years first. Join Jake on his next grand adventure as he learns what it means to be a newly ascended divinity, how to survive in such a strange new world, and how he might just have an unexpected edge on everyone and everything that’s out to get him—by learning how to craft his own magical cards!</p> <p>**Boasting a 4.7-star rating with over 11,000 reviews on Amazon/Audible, this sequel is a must-have for fans of Gamelit novels, wild adventures, and stories about regular people traveling to strange new worlds. Also, stay tuned for the third book in the series, which is gonna be even bigger, crazier, and full of even more magical cards. And it’s coming out in just a couple of months!**</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
