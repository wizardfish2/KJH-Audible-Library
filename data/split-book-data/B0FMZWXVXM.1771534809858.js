Improve the women around him—that’s where the fun begins.</b></p> <p>When Titan pilot David Snyder loses his squad, he takes the helm and finishes the mission. Trained. Focused. Deadly. He’s the kind of soldier the Coalition needs and the kind his new squad can’t ignore.</p> <p>Forged by fire and brought together by war, David now leads a lethal team: a sharp-tongued ace with a chip on his shoulder, a by-the-book commodore’s daughter, and a rookie straight out of the academy with something to prove.</p> <p>David’s not just here to survive. He’s here to win. And that means keeping his squad alive, outmaneuvering the alien war machines, and staying one step ahead of the heat, on and off the battlefield.</p>";
