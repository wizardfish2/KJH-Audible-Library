window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Doc left Deep Gulch behind him, setting out to Furden to continue spreading Luck’s name. The trip to the capital of Coalrud gave him yet another opportunity to use his knowledge to start new business ventures. While the hot springs would take time to prepare— Doc had a vision for it becoming a tourist destination—that was far from the last thing he’d get involved in during his stay.<br> <br> The city had allies to make, the most notable being David Roquefell, whose family used to worship the goddess of trade. The wealthy man quickly became a close associate and friend to Doc and his family. Together, Doc spun out other ways to make money, knowing he’d need them in the future.<br> <br> Along with Roquefell, Doc tied himself to the Ironbeard dwarven clan that made Furden their home. Becoming their shaman wasn’t difficult, even with one of the older elders being uncertain of Doc’s ideas.<br> <br> It wasn’t all an easy, happy time for Doc, though—Furden also had its unsavory people. The sheriff, Donadin, was all too happy to take bribes, but wasn’t as blatantly corrupt as Grange had been. Michael Strongarm, a local businessman, held a majority of the river property, using them as slums. It was clear that Strongarm thought little to nothing of the bestials that lived there. That grated on Doc, setting the two men up for a coming conflict.<br> <br> The most worrisome person there was the soulsmith, Richard Steward. Steward had been a little too eager to get his hands on soul stones for his own purposes. Doc found that the twisted man was using them to control the bestial women of the Iniquitous Den, taking away their freewill. That put the two men on a collision course that was coming quickly.<br> <br> With plans in the works and his allies and enemies aiming to remove him, Doc knew the future would be uncertain. Even if things turned deadly, Doc would keep pressing on. Even if the road became difficult, he’d keep putting one foot in front of the other.</p>";
