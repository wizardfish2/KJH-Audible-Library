window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Aliens ripped a hole above Earth, arriving with a massive space station. I sorta figured we'd be enslaved to fight in their wars or exterminated for our resources. Nope. The hip-high Iglax were merchants with ugly squished faces and thick blue fur. While they weren't much to look at, they sure did have some wonderous technology.</p> <p>Humanity bent over backwards to appease our new merchant overlords. The boorish aliens wanted cheap labor for precious metals, and honestly, I didn't blame anyone for their hunger to be among the stars.</p> <p>For certain rare metals or special gems, they'd trade tech we could only fathom as magic. Me, I pawned a few things, made some money, then hunkered down to study to prove my worth. <br> <br> The aliens tested humans on an individual basis for miner rentals. Do well on your pilot test, get a spaceship, sign up with a corp, and you can mine the belt. For a puddle-jumper pilot like me, yeah, I was so interested I became obsessed. When I finally tested, I performed above and beyond, being offered a contract for some better than a miner - Earth's First Starfighter.</p> <p>Warning: Morally gray MC. There's no graphic sex or harem. No stats, straight Sci-Fi first person space-shooter progression.</p>";
