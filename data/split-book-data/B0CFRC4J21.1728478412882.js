Fearful of the Earth being ravaged, Van and the crew go on high alert to keep his homeworld free of galactic influence.</p> <p>That vision is shattered when Tony Burgess captures an alien ship... in Wisconsin. The ship isn't just a stray workboat. It's the opening ploy of a group that sees humanity as a business opportunity too big to pass up.</p> <p>Advancing in rank, Van is torn between two dutiesâ€”to his crew and to his home. Since he isn't willing to give up the safety of either, he'll have to find a third way. Unfortunately for the forces against him, that path will include violence.</p>";
