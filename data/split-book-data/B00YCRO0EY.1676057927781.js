window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Some call me Shaman Bond, but I was born Eddie Drood: the latest in a long line of folks who chase monsters out of closets for a living to keep humanity safe from all that is dark, demonic, and just downright evil. Needless to say,we've made our fair share of enemies over the centuries - and made some questionable bargains. </p> <p>In exchange for the power to fight the forces of darkness, my parents signed over their souls. They're not the only ones who've made deals with heaven, hell, and every otherworldly realm in between, but now the bill's due for several big names in the supernatural community...including my girl, Molly. She, my parents, and other major players have been kidnapped so they'll pay up or participate in the \"Big Game\". The rules are simple: get from one side of the pocket dimension to the other, and kill your competitors. The winner's debt is paid in full, and the losers get themselves permanently lost, body and soul, forever. </p> <p>To save my loved ones, I've got to become a ringer in this deadly contest that's undoubtedly rigged by the powers that be.... </p>";
