window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Dead or alive?</b></p> <p>Not a hard question, and pretty easy to figure out either way. Usually.</p> <p>Except I've somehow woken up in a place called Hell, and I'm not entirely sure I died first. I thought it was a practical joke. Until a warrior woman tried to kill me and I rescued an elf and a succubus from slavers.</p> <p>Turns out, this Hell is being terrorized by an evil king, and he’s hell-bent on bringing all of Hell under his dominion. He also happens to control the portal back to our world, which I very much want to use.</p> <p>So here I am, preparing for battle against an army of 10,000 wraiths, Hellhounds, and sorcerers. If we win, Hell might be changed forever. But the chances of that are achingly slim.</p> <p><i>This omnibus contains all four books of the complete Wraith King series.</i></p>";
