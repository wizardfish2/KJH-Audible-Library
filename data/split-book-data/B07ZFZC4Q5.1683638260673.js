window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The citizens of Azurvale are starting to feel the pressure. War with the Empire to the south is imminent, and there's talk of the city's adventurers being drafted into the campaign. Though this conflict seems inevitable and promises to be horrific, the common folk can do little but act like there's nothing wrong. Rather than lose sleep over something so wildly out of their control, they instead worry about tiny, personal, inconsequential issues. Things like, \"Will the butcher have fresh steak today?\" and, \"Should I get those new boots now, or wait and see if they go on sale?\"</p> <p>However, though they try to maintain some modicum of normalcy, the people of Azurvale have yet to find out that their capital is already under threat. Not by some warmongering nation, but by a certain individual that has come to them seeking asylum, knowledge, profit, and power through any means necessary. As this newcomer burrows into the city's underbelly like a voracious tick, it cares not for the people it hurts along the way. Indeed, any soul unfortunate enough to cross paths with Boxxy T. Morningwood seems doomed to have their life ruined in one way or another. Often through no fault of their own.</p> <p>Whether it's an ancient being, a skilled assassin, a godlike archer, or a fresh-faced recruit, none shall be spared from the whims of chaos.</p> <p>Content warning: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content.</p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater Team for this production:</p> <ul> <li>Jeff Hays - narration, sound design</li> <li>Annie Ellicott - Keira, Rowana, the Dryads, and the rest of the new female cast&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Dalton Lynne - editing and proofing</li> <li>Ahmed Mahmoud - editing, music, sound design, and mastering</li> </ul>";
