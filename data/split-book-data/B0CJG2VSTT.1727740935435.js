She's been selected to travel to the royal palace in Dorsay to have the king confirm Talnier's charter. So, with her fellow adventurers by her side, she begins her journey to the capital.</p> <p>But while it sounds like a simple diplomatic trip, Kandis has managed to gain a few enemies during her brief time in Latora. And one—if not all—of them would be more than happy to ensure she never returns home . . .</p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than 600,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
