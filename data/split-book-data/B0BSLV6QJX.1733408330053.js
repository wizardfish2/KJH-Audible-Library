window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Three books. More than 40 hours of LitRPG goodness!</i></b></p> <p><b>Jump into a fantasy role-playing adventure where the System merges dice rolls, a snarky game master, ability incentivized class-leveling, multi-realm base-building, dungeon diving, and a quest to learn the ultimate spell.</b></p> <p>When Kenny is chosen for InterRealm, a real-life wargame where defenders are portaled in from their homeworld, he is forced to survive in a violent fantasy landscape.</p> <p>Build a powerful presence in InterRealm and his homeworld will <i>likely </i>remain safe.</p> <p>Fail, and the invaders will break through.</p> <p>If there’s any consolation prize between Kenny getting to be a famous wizard, or building a Dread-fortress from the bones of his enemies, it may not be enough to make up for the fact that real live orcs are trying to kill him. To top it all off, the game master in his head couldn’t be <i>any </i>less impressed with his assignment.</p> <p>Someone obviously botched their chances when they chose future-college-dropout Kenny. His opportunity to prove everyone wrong starts now....</p> <p><b>Don't miss this special-edition LitRPG series Omnibus from debut author Theo Hodges. It's perfect for fans of Sean Oswald, Dakota Krout, and Shirtaloon.</b></p>";
