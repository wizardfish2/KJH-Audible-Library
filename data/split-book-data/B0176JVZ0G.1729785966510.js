window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book 2 of the Demon Accords. </p> <p>It's been seven months since Chris Gordon met Tanya Demidova, and a lot has changed. He's stronger and faster and has the senses of a vampire and the appetite of a werewolf. But even as he settles into his new position with the Special Situations Squad and his relationship with Tanya, new threats appear. From south of the border, north of the city, inside the NYPD, and the federal government. But the hardest fight Chris will face is with himself. Sometimes the demon inside is the most dangerous! </p>";
