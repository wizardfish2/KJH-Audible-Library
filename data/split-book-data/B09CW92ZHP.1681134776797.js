window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of the </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal </i></b><b>best seller</b><b><i> Barking Up the Wrong Tree </i></b><b>comes a cure-all for our increasing emotional distance and loneliness—a smart, surprising, and thoroughly entertaining guide to help build better friendships, reignite love, and get closer to others, whether you’re an extrovert or introvert, socially adept or socially anxious.</b></p> <p><i>Can you judge a book by its cover?&nbsp;</i></p> <p><i>Is a friend in need truly a friend indeed?&nbsp;</i></p> <p><i>Does love conquer all?&nbsp;</i></p> <p><i>Is no man an island?&nbsp;</i></p> <p>In <i>Plays Well with Others,</i> Eric Barker dives into these questions, drawing on science to reveal the truth beyond the conventional wisdom about human relationships. Combining his compelling storytelling and humor, Barker explains what hostage negotiation techniques and marital arguments have in common, how an expert con-man lied his way into a 20-year professional soccer career, and why those holding views diametrically opposed to our own actually have the potential to become our closest, most trusted friends.</p> <p>Leveraging the best evidence available—free of platitudes or magical thinking—Barker analyzes multiple sides of an issue before rendering his verdict. What he’s uncovered is surprising, counterintuitive, and timely—and will change the way you interact in the world and with those around you just when you need it most.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
