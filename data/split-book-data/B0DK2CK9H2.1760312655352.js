His refuge has grown in size and population, and he’s begun to spread knowledge of the old ways of magic in an attempt to revive the lost art to humanity.</p> <p>There are no more answers to be found at home, and it’s time Keiran sees what’s out there with his own eyes. Armed with more mana than ever, he leaves his sanctuary to explore what’s left of the old kingdoms of the world and plumb their depths for lost secrets.</p> <p>What he finds is a civilization wrapped up in mysteries and lies, ones that could threaten to break the world a second time.</p> <p>Keiran will have to untangle it all before it’s too late.</p>";
