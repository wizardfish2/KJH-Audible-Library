Is there magic in your veins or not?</p> <p>In life, you start off and get what you get—that's fate. Then you grab the reins and steer your path—that's free will. Fate versus free will . . . it's mind bendy.</p> <p>But what if you want to change your stars?</p> <p>When a gathering of reapers descends on Toronto, and a mass-death is pending, Clan Cumhaill fights through kidnappings, betrayal, and death to discover what will cause the disaster. Is it a vampire war, the theft of a powerful artifact, or an empowered icon gone rogue?</p> <p>There's no way to know until the danger unfolds.</p>";
