window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Max has his home area protected now, with Maggie's help. He's trying to bring more people into the safe zone they created and while he does that, he's also fixing some electronics to work alongside the mana that's infusing everything.</p> <p>Despite the quarantine and its promise of danger, a number of people are intentionally trying to enter it after hearing the tales of what goes on inside.</p> <p>Meanwhile Prometheus has learned that radioactive materials can help open the wormhole further, allowing the mana to flow through and assimilate the Earth more quickly.</p> <p>With the influx of additional mana from Prometheus's actions, the overly large, mutated animals are showing up more often now. Because of that, the safe zone walls have to be improved, and while they're at it, they decide to enlarge the area within the walls since they're getting more people than they'd anticipated.</p> <p>With the number of people in the safe zone, and Max's depleting stock of beer, they decide that there needs to be at least one trip to a larger town, to scavenge things from the areas that were evacuated. Unfortunately, not everyone left when the evacuation was called, and now there are human dangers to face as well.</p>";
