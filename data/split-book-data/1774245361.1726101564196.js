window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The surprise attack within the Auriga Star System was worse than brutal; it was heinous, leaving the US Navy's 3rd Fleet decimated.</b></p> <p>Thousands of crew are reported dead, including the ship’s captain. Reluctantly, the young XO, Galvin Quintos, will be taking command of the fleet's crippled dreadnaught, the USS <i>Hamilton</i>, while doing his best to bring fleet survivors back to Earth. To make matters worse, there’s a murderer running loose on board the ship, critically low fuel levels, <i>and </i>the Grish are back, in fast pursuit and ready to finish what they’d started. Only by sheer luck - and a good measure of cagey smarts - will Quintos be able to rise to the challenge.</p>";
