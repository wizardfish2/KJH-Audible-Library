So long as he has Matty - Astrid's mom, and the love of his very long life - everything will be okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>So they're gonna party with the trolls, who celebrate Matty's distant troll lineage like she's one of their own, and you best believe they celebrate the dragon child that shares a tiny bit of their blood, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But not all trolls are happy with their situation beneath the Jotunheimen Mountains in Norway.
