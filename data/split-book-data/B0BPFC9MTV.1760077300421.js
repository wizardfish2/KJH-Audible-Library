A tad boring, even.</b></p> <p>It thus came as no small shock to her when she was chosen by a god.</p> <p>Suddenly thrust into a new world where magic, monsters, and character levels are par for the course, Tess will find that simply surviving can be a challenge. It doesn't help that dark forces are stirring, she's woefully underpowered, and spiders keep trying to claw her face off.</p> <p>One thing's for certain, though: if she can overcome it all, the possibilities are endless. Will she end up wrestling a dragon? Becoming an arch-mage? Opening up a quaint wine bar and bookstore for elves? The choice is hers...as long as she can live long enough to make it.</p> <p><i>Protagonist </i>is a fairly classic LitRPG novel with character levels, classes, stats, settlements, and other LitRPG elements.</p>";
