window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Things were supposed to settle down after the Bloodrock war. Even with the upcoming wedding to Verka, things should have gotten calm. For a time, it even looked like it might, giving the family hope. However, Krogga was proving to be a far more dangerous post than they’d thought it would be.</p> <p>The spies who’d been hounding them had to be dealt with, revealing them to be a few clans from the empire. They’d had to kill all involved, only bringing further trouble when an Imperial investigator arrived to question them. They held strong, and eventually, the investigator left with more than enough evidence of the clans being sanctioned.</p> <p>The wedding finally arrived, and the family celebrated Verka joining them. Gregory overcame the ritual of the climb up the temple road, including talking Ragnar down. Having married Verka just before the solstice, all of them were looking forward to a week off to enjoy their newest addition.</p> <p>Sadly, it was right in the middle of the Festival of Krog that Buldoun blundered. Launching an unprovoked and deadly attack, Buldoun might have managed to capture or decimate the city if not for Gregory’s foresight. When the attack was finally thwarted and the Buldounish ships sailed off, the city began to pick itself back up.</p> <p>The Pettits did their best to help the city, all while wondering what would happen next. More of their family would be arriving during the year, and Krogga would be turning its angry gaze toward Buldoun. There was so much waiting to be settled that anything could happen, and they still had years left on their posting in Krogga.</p>";
