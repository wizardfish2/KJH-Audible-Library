Louella is working to pick up the pieces that were seemingly held together only through the glue that was Regan. Can Louella rise to the occasion without the Regan's aid?</p> <p>With Lelune's followers decimated or losing faith along with the ever-ambitious Cassin finally making his presence in Celestia felt, the world is literally crashing down around her. That doesn't mean Lelune is going to lie down and let it happen. It has been a long time since the Celestials went to war. Can Murgin survive it?</p> <p>The only thing keeping Alara going, the only light in a world consisting of darkness, is her daughter, the inquisitive and energetic Nara. That fact is only compounded by the dungeons of the north having broken free of Regan's control. They are waging all-out war. Kenia seeks revenge, and Tzulxuc seeks simply to regain his lost power. Can Alara muster the strength to stop them?</p> <p>With the gnomish legacy behind her, Izora heads out to seek answers to questions that seemingly have none. A burning desire in her soul is leading her to the one place that the world considers off-limits now: Saymar, home of the demons.</p>";
