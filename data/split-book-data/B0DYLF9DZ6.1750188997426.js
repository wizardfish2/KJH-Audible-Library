With a heart of gold, boots of steel, and a great big wrench, Colton will soon become the ultimate . . . Trailer Park Manager.</p> <p>Trailer Park Elves is a hilarious slice-of-life fusion of fantasy, household maintenance, and low-stakes adventure. If you liked Isekai Emperor, you’ll find more of the same goodness in this spiritual successor.</p>";
