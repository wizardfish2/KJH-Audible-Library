He works for the company and does all he can to make sure they succeed.</p> <p>From cleaning up after a bad operation and disposing of bodies to providing hush money, getting rid of agents from opposing intelligence communities, or just helping an informant escape from a Super Villain, Edmund has done it all in this line of work.</p> <p>That doesn’t fill up the entirety of his life, however.</p> <p>The rest of it is trying to get a date with the woman he likes and looking out for his little sister while hiding the fact he himself has a superpower.</p> <p>A superpower that lets him save and load the world whenever he likes as if it were a video game and subject to his personal whims.</p> <p>At least, that’s what he thought in the beginning.</p>";
