Mind blown.</p> <p>The deadly Poreskoro family wants to feed on my fae essence. Rude. And if they succeed, they'll gain the strength to rebuild their army of evil. Terrifying.</p> <p>Demons, drug lords, and deception I can handle, but when a dark storm of danger falls over my family, things have gone too far.</p> <p>With evil brewing, enemies running rampant, and fae criminals gunning for me and my family, I widen my stance and get ready for the hits. Who's manipulating things behind the scenes? Who's coming after the people I care about? And who the hell is stupid enough to think I'd let it happen?</p>";
