My sophomore year is starting early, introducing me to new classes and new girls, including a quiet tomboy named Andie and an obsessive redhead named Emma.</p> <p>The girls aren’t the only ones on my radar though. News of an ancient demonic artifact surfaces for the first time in generations, and somehow, it’s linked to me. It’s going to take every connection I have to find it, and it just might lead to something that can destroy the entire Nine Circles.</p> <p>Only a powerful demon lord can save the artifact. It’s time to go to work.</p>";
