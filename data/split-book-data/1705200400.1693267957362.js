Part of a raid group that was led by two Great Guilds, and had the intention of conquering the Tower. But, no one who had ventured beyond the third floor had ever returned.&nbsp;</p> <p>Adventuring might be a dangerous profession, and ascended might encounter death at every turn, but there is a reason why most do not attempt to climb the Tower. For most ascended going into the Tower is a risk not worth taking, in opinions of some, it was equal to suicide. But there were a few who still dreamed of something more than pointless living.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Preparations for the attempt to climb the Tower begin, led by some of the most powerful ascended in the world. But Morgan and his friends still had a lot to learn before they were strong enough to survive the first floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Attempting to climb the Tower took more than just will, it required training and planning. And Morgan and his friends needed to learn how to work with the rest of the ascended in the raid group if they were to have a chance to survive. In the end, there was only one truth, and the Tower revealed who an ascended truly was. The Tower would show them if they were worthy of gaining greater power.</p>";
