An alliance Kingdoms are made from.</b></p> <p>Centuries before a certain dungeon first met a wise pink wisp, the world was torn apart by war. For a time, even the Guild was shaken to its core as a wave of necromantic cultivators surged forth from the dark corners of the earth.</p> <p>Garron feels the impact of war differently than most, as a servant in the estate of a Mage that left for the war. The young lord Andros and his servant have been left in the <i>tender </i>care of the ambitious cultivator, Jackson. The workload is a death sentence: Andros is forced to train in near-isolation, and Garron has fallen ill. One fateful night, they make a run for survival and freedom.</p> <p>Jackson doesnâ€™t take kindly to his meal ticket vanishing into the night. The Hunt is on.</p>";
