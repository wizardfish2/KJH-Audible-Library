And Boyd had ensured justice caught up to Royce’s murderer, the man who had made him the Hero he was. Victory Seeker had paid, in the end, for all his many crimes. It hadn’t been pretty, and it wasn’t something he was particularly proud of, but it was done. But the Emissaries Victory Seeker released are still out there. And though no intelligence has come in to reveal what they are up to, it can’t be good.</p> <p>But Boyd and a few of his Devoted had gone rogue to ensure their former mentor didn’t get away. And though it was a slap on the wrist, the Devoted’s Captain was placed on administrative leave for nearly two months. With too much time on his hands, the big demon must move beyond his tender trial.</p> <p>The team works on a movie together to publicize Boyd’s past. There’s training he can do… getting used to and integrating Tinker’s latest toys into his repertoire. He has Connor’s visit to look forward to. He even starts to cook again. But the kitchen is Daisy’s domain—and getting past the fairy’s prickly nature to have her open up may be more than even he has the patience for. Fortunately, Sinoe offers a way to get Boyd out of the base—offering to bring him to meet the infamous ‘She’ who sicced Omega Ray on the Devoted, nearly killing Raev, Silvie, and Boyd.</p> <p>Are there too many cooks in the kitchen? Will Boyd rise to the occasion? And is this ‘She’ his enemy, or will Stepper’s group that Boyd has come into contact with several times now reveal the evil plans the Emissaries have for the Changed?</p> <p>Join Boyd and his Devoted in the eighth book of the Dashing Devil series to find out.</p>";
