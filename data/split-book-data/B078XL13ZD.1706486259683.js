window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Split Second</i> was the 27th best-selling Kindle book of 2017 - out of almost six million titles. Now, this blockbuster continues with <i>Time Frame</i>, a stand-alone near-future thriller that will leave you breathless. </p> <p><b>A daring attempt to go back a split second in time to destroy Kim Jong-un. A discovery so consequential it dwarfs even time travel. And a treacherous enemy bent on revenge.</b> </p> <p>Lee Cargill is the head of Q5, a secret organization that can send objects a split second back into the past. And while this seems utterly useless, it turns out to be the most powerful capability the world has ever known. Those who control it can transform civilization - or destroy it entirely. </p> <p>When Cargill sends Aaron Blake, his most formidable operative, on an unauthorized mission to destroy Kim Jong-un, all hell breaks loose. As Blake battles for his life, his chances of thwarting the North Korean tyrant plummet. But they're about to get far worse. Because China has learned of Q5 technology, and they'll stop at nothing to hunt Blake down.... </p> <p>And all the while, a powerful enemy has reemerged. An enemy who seeks to use time travel technology to achieve a twisted, psychopathic vision that will leave millions dead - starting with Lee Cargill and the entire Q5 team. </p> <p><i>Time Frame </i>is a roller-coaster ride of a thriller, one packed with fascinating concepts that listeners will be contemplating long after it's over. </p>";
