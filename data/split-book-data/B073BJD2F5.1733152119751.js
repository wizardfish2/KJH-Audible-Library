window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a world full of super powers, Felix has a pretty crappy one. </p> <p>He has the ability to modify any item he owns. To upgrade anything. </p> <p>Sounds great on paper. Almost like a video game. </p> <p>Except that the amount of power it takes to actually change, modify, or upgrade anything worthwhile is beyond his abilities. </p> <p>With that in mind, Felix settled into a normal life. A normal job. </p> <p>His entire world changes when the city he lives in is taken over by a super villain. Becoming a country of one city. A city state. </p> <p>Surprisingly, not a whole lot changed. Politicians were still corrupt. Banks still held onto your money. And criminals still committed crime. </p> <p>Though the black market has become more readily available. </p> <p>And in that not-so-black market, Felix discovers he has a way to make his power useful after all, and grasps a hold of his chance with both hands. </p> <p><b><i>Warning and minor spoiler: </i></b><i>This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/partial harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show. Listen at your own risk. </i></p>";
