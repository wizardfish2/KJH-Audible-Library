Summoned from another dimension, the wraiths are immune to most forms of attack-and they eat life force. A deadly threat to everyone in Kortall, the wraiths change the balance of power completely.</p> <p>The Council is on the march again. If Smith and his allies cannot find a way to defeat the wraiths, everything will be lost!</p> <p>There's one chance. Legend says there was a Sword of Light carried by a hero centuries ago. If it's real, the sword would be a deadly weapon against the wraiths, but nobody has seen it in hundreds of years.</p> <p>The quest to find the sword will demand everything from the seekers.</p> <p>But if they fail, everything in their world will fall to shadow!</p>";
