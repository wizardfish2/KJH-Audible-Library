window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Shadow Master Series: Books 1-3</i> is a darkly comedic SFF genre-hopping omnibus that chronicles the adventures of Jackson Blackwell, the universe's first villain advisor and the titular Shadow Master. A villain protagonist you love to hate. Or hate that you love him?<br> <br> This fourth wall-breaking three-book collection showcases Jackson's adventures through fantasy realms, comic book universes, and classic space opera settings. Each fast-paced novel allows Jackson to flex his powers, skills, and wits as he exploits the rules, points out the respective genre's flaws, and undermines godly authority to win the day. All the while laughing at the expense of our beloved tropes. Because that is what villains should do, shouldn’t they?<br> <br> This multi-award nominated (and even a win) collection contains:</p> <ul> <li><i>Villains Rule: The Shadow Master, Book 1</i></li> <li><i>Villains Pride: The Shadow Master, Book 2</i></li> <li><i>Villains Deception: The Shadow Master, Book 3</i></li> </ul>";
