window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new world. A thousand threats. Welcome to The Continent.</b></p> <p>Felix's life on Earth had become a series of dead-end jobs, ruined relationships, and rotating apartments smaller than most postage stamps. By all accounts, even his own, he was a coward. Too afraid to move forward, to take risks. Yet when given the chance to choose between risking his life or walking away from a deadly encounter, he didn't hesitate.&nbsp;</p> <p>Moments before his untimely demise, Felix was snatched from earth and thrust into a magical world known only as \"The Continent\". Empowered by the \"System\", he learns that he can strengthen himself through combat and dedication. To survive, he'll have to push himself beyond his limits, or else fall to the monsters all around him.</p> <p>Levels, stats, and magic. Death is the start of a terrible fate, but if he lives...no one knows what he will become.</p>";
