window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In a world on the brink, survival isn’t just a game—it’s the only game. But when only one soul holds all the cards, they get to play however they want.</b></p> <p>Argrave, the royal bastard of House Vasquer, went into his magic apprenticeship cruel and awkward, yet left it with a neat dignity and an acerbic wit. But beneath the veneer of self-assurance, the body’s new soul is wrestling with the dread of existence in a reality that once existed only in the pages of fantasy.</p> <p>In the blink of an eye, a wiki editor’s deep and somewhat unhealthy understanding of a game becomes useful, usable knowledge when he inexplicably replaces the once-cruel royal bastard. Before he can start to push his frail body to use his deep understanding of the lore to handle the imminent apocalypse, or go off to stop an invasion, there’s a more personal task he needs to handle first. His cousin has a knife in her hand, and death in her eyes.</p>";
