window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Four resurrected souls. One Devil’s Pact. One final chance.</p> <p>Famine, known as Petor in his previous life, joins forces with the legendary figures of Conquest, Death, and War.</p> <p>Together, they form the resurrected Four Horsemen, their lives reignited by a devil’s pact. Resurrected in the bowels of a forgotten temple, buried under a city in the midst of a siege, they’ll have to find a way out.</p> <p>The devil’s deals are always double edged, while they breathe once more their cultivation is gone. To recover it, they’ll have to use all of their skills to craft and fight.</p> <p>Beyond the city’s walls the devil’s contracts await them. Promising gold and access to their devil’s wares. Gear that could change their fates.</p> <p>If they fail, there is no devil waiting to snatch up their souls—no chance for them to rewrite the last line in their stories.</p>";
