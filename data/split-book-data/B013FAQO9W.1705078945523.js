But even back then, sorcerer Nate Garrett, aka Hellequin, knew there was more to it than simple savage pleasureâ€”souls were being stolen.</p> <p>Nate's discovery of the souls' use, and of those supporting the group's plan, made him question everything he believed.</p> <p>Now the group Nate thought long dead is back. Violent, angry, and hell-bent on revenge, they have Hellequin firmly in their sights. And if he won't come willingly, they'll take those closest to him first.</p> <p>The battle begins again.</p>";
