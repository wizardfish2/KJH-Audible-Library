window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Finance isn't detective Nick Waite’s strong suit, but he’s learning fast as he investigates the cover-up of a murder inside Neo Babylon’s oldest bank.</b></p> <p>The winds of conspiracy whirl around him, and everyone from the police commissioner to gang lords warn him to step back.</p> <p>Taking the easy way out isn’t in his nature, however. He’s gotten where he is by being stubborn and a chance to knock a corrupt bank down a peg is too good to pass up.</p> <p>But all isn’t well with his partners, the police’s elite Archangels. A new prototype model is about to be deployed, and she has her own views on humanity to force on her brethren. Nick feels more like an AI whisperer than a detective some days.</p> <p>Through it all, the city continues to smolder like a powder keg ready to blow. This case will determine more than the fate of a few banking executives.</p>";
