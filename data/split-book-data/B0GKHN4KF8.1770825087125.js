window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What would you do if your everyday life working a dead end job to survive was interrupted, but not by sickness or disaster, but instead by an accident that crossed dimensions to give you odd powers and a whole mess of secrets to keep? Especially if that accident also results in you still having to work a day job to keep a roof over your head?</p> <p>Liam Cosgrave has been wrestling with that whole situation for weeks now. An accident summoned him to another world and his own need to help people bonded him to a pair of young sorceresses, but not as a hero to save the world. Instead, he's basically their bodyguard and friend. All while still having to load trucks during the week to pay rent.</p> <p>He's gotten used to the strange power that the System (an extra-dimensional supercomputer who manages the transit between dimensions) and earned the love of a good woman who is also a miniature lamia bent on causing as much trouble as possible. He's even getting closer to her friend, the wolf kin fourth princess of the realm, Rieka Coldeye, who loves headpats more than anything but can't admit it in public. However, in a world as chaotic as theirs, peace is not something that will last for long.</p> <p>New missions arise, new threats emerge, and through it all they have to continue to do work on the side to earn the funds necessary to continue their study and pay the magical costs to summon Liam to them. Even being young noblewomen does not exclude them from the cost of magic in this world, so they have to salvage every bit they can from the ruins they explore, monsters they hunt, and bandits they exterminate.</p> <p>To some, what Liam does is just a job. But this world is rapidly growing to include all that he loves, despite being forced to return to Earth regularly. How will he balance things out?</p>";
