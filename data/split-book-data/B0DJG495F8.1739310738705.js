window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Includes all four books in the completed Immersion Online series: </b><b><i>The Noob, The Zealot, The Symbiont,</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Herald.</i></b></p> <p>My name is Charlie Mason, but everyone just calls me Mace. I was a detective—and a damn good one—for the Special Crimes Unit for nearly twenty years before I was forced to retire. Unfortunately, my pension wasn't enough to pay for my daughter's college, so I went to work for Immersion Online, the hottest virtual reality game in the world, as an in-game Constable.</p> <p>I'll admit it! I knew squat about video games, leveling up, and strategies to max out my character's skills. What I did know, however, was how to solve crimes!</p> <p>The crimes should have been no big deal—just part of quest lines. Regrettably, the ones I had to deal with were just as challenging as the ones I had faced as a detective: tracking down the location of the most famous avatar in the game, battling fanatics who wanted to kick the players from the game for good, hunting a serial killer whose murders spread to the real world, to finally having to figure out how all of these pieces fit together.</p> <p>What these criminals didn't know was that my team—my deputy Tinsie, my golem Buddy, and my virtual assistant Havervill—and I were on the case! And we wouldn't stop until the guilty had been brought to justice.</p>";
