window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After seizing the battle frigate Merciless, Benning Kidd is finally captain of her own vessel, but her fate still seems to be out of her control. Bounty hunters swarm her at every opportunity, and she's only safe in the gladiatorial arenas of the Collective. Old enemies plague her, and new ones arise wherever she goes. To make matters worse, strange memories that aren't her own start cropping up in her thoughts. If Benning can't trust her own mind, then she can't trust anyone or anything!</p> <p>The safest option is to run and hide, but that's not the path of a Stellar Corsair. Benning will have to take the fights to her foes and teach them what it means to cross a warrior without conscience or empathy. Her enemies will learn to fear the Drone Captain!</p>";
