window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Jenkins dreams of being immortal... lucky for him, nine lives are plenty of time to perfect his cultivation.</b></p> <p>With magic and friendship on his side, life in the forest is good. Blessed by the Sun, Jenkins spends his days fishing with River, dancing with the Mists, and singing with Moon, all the while maintaining impeccable toe-beans and a flawless coat. Because to cleanse a meridian is to cleanse oneself, after all, inside and out.</p> <p>But Life isn't all sunbeams and starlight. Every kitten must grow up eventually, and Jenkins is no exception. Heavenly trials and tribulations follow his every triumph, as Death looms in the shadows. Curiosity might not kill this cat, but a pestilent horde of rats and their demonic king just might.</p> <p>Nine lives may not be enough to save himself, but if Jenkins can come to understand Death, then maybe, just maybe, he can save his home instead. And everyone knows, a cat always lands on its feet.</p> <p><i>A mostly cozy, slice-of-life western cultivation. Redwall x Lovecraft x Beware of Chicken. A standalone story in the Liches Get Stitches universe.</i></p>";
