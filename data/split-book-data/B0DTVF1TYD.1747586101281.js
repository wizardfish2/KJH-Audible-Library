Wrench and his people are working the part of a crew and earning their keep. Being treated as equals of worth instead of pets.</p> <p>Except even as things change, there will always be problems that spring up. Things that break all on their own.

The fix-it list only grows and the tools he has at his disposal are getting worn out.</p> <p>With any luck, this job will be done and Wrench can take some time off.</p>";
