Barely escaping with my life, I stumble into a secluded community of unnervingly attractive monster girls.<br> <br> There’s a gorgeous dhampir with an aversion to blood, a sultry siren who can’t hold a tune, and a shy deergirl with a heart of gold. And somehow, they’ve all set their sights on me.<br> <br> But something dangerous is stalking the town, and these peaceful villagers aren’t prepared for what’s coming. To defend my new home, I’ll have to teach them to fight as a team.<br> <br> They say love is a battlefield. They weren’t kidding.</p>";
