window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Fight, survive, adapt, and rely only on yourself.</b></p> <p>That is Derek’s creed and what's got him through the System Integration on Earth.</p> <p>Everything changed when the System came. Cute bunnies and beautiful butterflies became savage killing machines. Then the Invaders arrived with a single goal: to obtain ownership of this new habitable planet.</p> <p>War has raged ever since.</p> <p>None of this mattered much to Derek, aside from making living a little more perilous. He mostly kept to himself. He was the weird guy who owned a cabin and who occasionally came into town for a drink and light conversation. After System Integration, that didn’t change much—he only got stronger.</p> <p>After years of fighting monsters and Invaders alone, he’s become quite adept at surviving. Who needs others to get in the way or worry about?</p> <p>Until one day, Derek goes against his better judgement. He decides to lend some help on a mission that doesn’t seem too hard.... He should have stuck to being alone....</p> <p><b>Don’t miss the start of this new LitRPG series starting on Earth a few years post System Integration. But the adventure doesn’t stop there. This overpowered protagonist will quickly find himself on a new world, with a new System, providing a unique combination of the isekai, LitRPG apocalypse, and slice-of-life genres. He may even make a few friends along the way.</b></p>";
