window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I wasn't supposed to fall in love with a werewolf, but he wasn't supposed to break my heart.</p> <p>But he did, and I can either wallow in misery for the rest of my life, or accept that being named after Little Red doesn't mean I have to remake all her mistakes. There's a world out there that doesn't know anything about fated mates, ancient vampire bloodlines, or hoods who magically control silver and have a permanent stick up their butts. (Or at least, the ones in my family do.) A world where I'm not constantly harangued by my mother to finally become the \"wolf watcher\" I was born to be and assume my rightful place at her side.</p> <p>And it's a world I'm growing to love, with its quirky humans, awesome Thai dumplings, and total lack of lupines...until the night an English werewolf shows up out of the blue and saves my life. All Tobias Somfield wants in return is a little help to track down some vampires. Only, what we discover when we do opens up our eyes to an entirely different kind of destiny. One that was laid down centuries ago when a warrior in a red hood and the alpha werewolf who loved her betrayed their own kind, creating enemies across the entire supernatural world in the process.</p> <p>Or was that really what happened at all, and will the truth, once revealed, save us or lead to our doom?</p> <p>And can we find some great kebabs some where along the way?</p> <p>The Red Chronicles is a mythpunked urban fantasy series spiked with comedy, mystery, and yes, a little romance along the way. Fur up and fly along!</p>";
