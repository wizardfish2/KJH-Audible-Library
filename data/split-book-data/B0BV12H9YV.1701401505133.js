window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Guess who may just need to end time? You got it: Jon Ryan may be forced to cancel, terminate, and definitively end time itself—everywhere.</b></p> <p>Why is he straying in that direction? Well, he wanted to fix the timeline. After the Clan no-timed Earth and Jon resurrected it, he was stressed that the new future would void out the very future that gave us our hero himself. So, Jon did his best to fix the timeline according to how he thought it should be.</p> <p>You know that feeling when you do something that doesn't turn out well at all, and then somebody asks you how it went—and you don't want to lie but you don't want to tell them the truth either? Yeah, that's kind of how it's going with Jon and his timeline repair job. He's changed time, but like monkey's paw magic, the results are not what he desired. Now, impossible, unexplainable, and undesirable events are happening all over universe. Jon is beginning to lose faith in his plan. By the way, everyone else did long ago.</p> <p>As reality dwindles, can Jon reverse his run of bad luck, or will he just make existence worse? All your questions will be answered. Now, we just need to find out if Jon will like those answers. Yikes! Better listen to this story sitting down.</p>";
