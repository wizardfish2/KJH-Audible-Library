window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Can Eight handle his biggest challenge yet; civilization?</b></p> <p>He’s carved a home out in the wilderness, and met its inhabitants, killing some and making friends with others. Things are looking downright cozy—in a bushcraft kind of way—but there’s a village to the east with tools, resources, and new magic to learn. That’s all incredibly tempting when living among the wild things.</p> <p>Where there are people though, there are complications, including the murder-y kind.</p> <p>Add a few ghosts, giant beasts, and a new god too, and...well...life’s hard for an old man trapped in a young boy’s body. And things are about to get much, much tougher. Still, all that wisdom and experience have to count for something, right?</p> <p><i>Eight: The Way of the Hunter</i> is part mystery, part ghost story, and all adventure. Follow Eight as he fights for his place in a new world using a System made of paths, soul marks, attributes, talents, and skills to explore it.</p>";
