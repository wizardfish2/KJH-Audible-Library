As the galaxy plunges into war, the Ixan Prophecies are being fulfilled, one by one. Humanity’s oldest enemy is on the rise, with weaponry never seen before.</p> <p>The fate of the galaxy now depends on Captain Keyes, his tired ship, and his oddball crew. It doesn’t pay to be right.</p> <p>Box set contains:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li><i>Supercarrier</i></li> <li><i>Juggernaut</i></li> <li><i>Reckoning</i></li> </ol> <p>Jump into the action.
