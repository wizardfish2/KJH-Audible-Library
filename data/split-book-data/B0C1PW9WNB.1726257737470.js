God has given him a choice: to take the life of the person meant to die that day and forget who he was, or to keep being Alex and transition to a world of magic where God would give him the tools to survive. Alex, an avid fan of fantasy, chooses the latter and is thrown through a black portal into a world he never could have imagined.</p> <p>Once there, he discovers that he has the ability to wield all five Elemental magics: Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and Mind.
