There it remained until Will found it and accidentally reactivated it, launching him light-years away.</p> <p>With the crew—and its prisoners—awakened from cryo-sleep, Will has no choice but to go along with Captain Fera and her pilot-turned-holographic AI. Seen as a naïve primitive, Will must navigate complex alien cultures, explore the far reaches of the galaxy, and battle a tyrannical empire seeking to finish off a haggard and weary rebel faction just to be granted a ticket back to Earth.</p> <p>As Will shows an uncanny ability to navigate the mysterious realm of wormhole travel known as the Void, he begins to thrive in a galaxy not meant for humans.</p> <p>Home is only a half-million light-years away, but when life on a spaceship is this much fun… does Will really want to go back?</p>";
