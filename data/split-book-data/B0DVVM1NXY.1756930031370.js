He may spend more time unclogging pipes than fighting monsters, but hey, it's a stable job, and that's what counts. With the help of his unregistered soul-devouring demonic familiar, he'll save enough to launch his career as an adventurerâ€”just as soon as he can afford some proper gear.</p> <p>When a dungeon unexpectedly opens beneath Halfbridge, it's the golden opportunity he's been looking for to get ahead. But when a simple dungeon raid goes wrong, Bernt finds himself on the front lines of a battle against an ancient foe. To survive, he'll need to master everything at his disposal, from his pyromancy to the growing bond with his demonic familiar.</p> <p>For most, waging a war in the sewers is a nightmare.</p> <p>For Bernt, it's just another workday.</p>";
