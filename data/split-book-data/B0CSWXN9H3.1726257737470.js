An alien AI called the System had taken over Earth and transformed his apartment building into a 100-floor dungeon tower of traps, monsters, and loot. Trapped at the top, Lucas and the other residents have just one year to reach the ground floor and escape before the tower self-destructs.</p> <p>That’s his first problem.</p> <p>The second is he slept through the System’s welcome orientation, so a Class was picked for him. Lucas is now a Blood Reaver. A brutal Class based on speed, ferocity, and striking from the shadows. He’s expected not to just defeat his enemies, but to slaughter them and bathe in their blood. Their blood is now his power.</p> <p>Outraged at being invaded, Lucas vows to grow stronger and take back his world. He will not only survive but thrive as he carves a bloody path to freedom.</p>";
