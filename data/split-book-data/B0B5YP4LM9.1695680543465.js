He picked a reasonably decent culture for her to grow up in. He trained her in her powers, taught her everything he could, and even broadened her horizons by touring other worlds, other times, other histories—and some futures! He did his best to be a good father and to prepare her for an uncaring universe.</p> <p>Why?
