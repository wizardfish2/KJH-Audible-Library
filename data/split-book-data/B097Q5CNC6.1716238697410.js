His girlfriend’s been marked for death by the immortal temptress who wants him. One’s a witch and the other’s a vampire, which means the chances of them talking out their problems over tea are slim to none.</p> <p>It’s bad enough Bill’s too distracted by evil leprechauns and redneck werewolves to put a stop to it, but now something massive has been spotted prowling the waters of the Hudson - a harbinger of biblical proportions, forewarning of dark times to come.</p> <p>With a tidal wave of chaos closing in, Bill will need to choose between his friends, his feelings, and the fate of the world.
