window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The exciting sequel to <i>Good Intentions</i>! Alex Carlisle has enough to deal with even on quiet days. Living with an angel and a succubus is no easy feat. One has divine responsibilities she can't explain, and the other tempts him toward a decadent lifestyle he's not sure he can manage. Add to that the stresses of college and trying to hold down a job, and it's lucky Alex can even keep his head on straight. </p> <p>Yet the complications keep on coming. An amorous (and terrifying) werewolf won't take no for an answer. Vampires from across the country want to know what happened to their allies in Seattle. To top it all off, events in the city have drawn the attention of federal agents who know far too much about the supernatural, and they have no patience for the chaos that Alex and his friends leave in their wake. </p>";
