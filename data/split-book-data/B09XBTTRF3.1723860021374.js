Without a friend in the galaxy, she finds herself dragged away for something those treacherous bastards did. </p> <p><i>What else could go wrong in one day?</i></p> <p>Help is coming, just not the kind Daria was expecting. A dapper gent she’s never met blasting the doors off her cell pulls Daria deeper into the rabbit hole.
