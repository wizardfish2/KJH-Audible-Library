window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One man. One game. One adorable baby dragon.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, Hector Park cheated death by uploading his mind to the ultra-immersive fantasy RPG game, <i>Archemi</i>. After exposing the rotten heart of an order of dragon knights, he’s now on the run with a young queen dragon who could one day become the most powerful mount in the game. </p> <p>To get strong enough to face their enemies, they need a quest - a big one. Fortunately, trouble has a way of finding Hector, and it does - in the form of a series of brutally murdered priests, a king in desperate need of a hero, and a beautiful, fiery berserker. The risk? Huge. The payoff? More gold than a dragon’s hoard.</p> <p>There's only one problem - <i>Archemi</i> is haunted by the ghost of a mad developer bent on making the game his personal playground. And now that the world outside has vanished in a storm of nuclear fire, there's no one left to stop him.</p> <p>Or at least, that’s what <i>he</i> thinks. Because Hector isn't the kind of man to take this shit lying down.</p>";
