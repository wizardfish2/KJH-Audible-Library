Now, two survivors are all that remain—one stranded on a ravaged Earth and the other newly rescued from the decaying International Space Station. Their struggle for survival and reunion soon spirals into something much larger, plunging them into a cosmic battle that transcends time, space, and even reality itself.</p> <p>In the silent, ghostly ruins of Geneva, an alien force has risen, constructing an unearthly city from the ashes of humanity’s greatest achievements. The origin? A rift opened at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, a gateway to alternate universes and worlds ravaged by the same merciless invaders. As they piece together the dark truth, the survivors must navigate parallel dimensions, face a xenophobic enemy bent on wiping all life from the multiverse, and confront a deadly time loop that seems determined to trap them forever. With each new world they encounter, hope for salvation dims. But together, they’re willing to risk everything—not only for a chance at survival but to rewrite the very fabric of reality and save a multiverse on the brink of extinction.</p> <p><i>Multitude</i> is a journey of survival and sacrifice, a mind-bending adventure across worlds where reality fractures and bends.
