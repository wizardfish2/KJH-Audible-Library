window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ignas Corvinus, ruler of Vlachia, has been captured by his worst enemies. A puppet ruler has been installed to lead the most powerful nation in Archemi, and he's doing his best to blame Hector Park, his dragon Karalti, and their allies for the world's problems.<br> <br> Hector has only two words for him: They start with F and end with \"you\".<br> <br> In the ongoing war between Archemi and the forces of the Void, the battle for the soul and throne of Vlachia is crucial. With one powerful nation recently conquered and the other being corrupted from within, the world's fate hinges on Hector leading his adopted homeland back from the brinkâ€”and perhaps playing a greater role in its future than he ever believed possible.<br> <br> Join Hector and Karalti on this epic <i>Final Fantas</i>y-style LitRPG adventure, in which the heroes find love, triumph, and struggle against overwhelming odds in the battle to save their world. May contain creative swearing, military humor, and excessive dragons.</p>";
