Frequently seen with a grumpy frog (crowned, judgmental). Answers to \"Evie\" or \"Stop that.\"</i><br> <br> Evie Sage didn't mean to become the right-hand woman to the kingdom's most terrifying villain. One minute, she was applying for an entry-level position that promised \"light paperwork and occasional beheadings,\" and the next, she was knee-deep in magical mayhem, murder plots, and an entirely inappropriate crush on her brooding, sharp-jawed, walking disaster of a boss.<br> <br> Now, with a magical prophecy unraveling, assassins showing up in the break room, and a suspicious amount of frogs wearing crowns, Evie has to figure out how to survive her job without setting the kingdom on fire―or her dignity, which is hanging by a very sarcastic thread.<br> <br> Being evil-adjacent was never part of the five-year plan. But then again...neither was falling for The Villain.<br> <br> <i>A magical office comedy with grumpy bosses, snarky frogs, and definitely-not-feelings.</i><br> <br> Contains mature themes.</p>";
