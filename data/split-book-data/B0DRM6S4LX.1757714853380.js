Now at the helm of his own Church, Fischer finally has some time to relax. But life in Tropica is much like fishing from a rocky shore: it's only a matter of time before you hook a snag.</p> <p>It seems chi has returned to the area, the Church of Fischer and the village of Tropica have grown, and at least one of Fischer's animal pals has experienced a breakthrough that defies metaphysical understanding. Furthermore, these developments send out waves of essence, their echoes spanning oceans and reaching distant shores.</p> <p>And unfortunately for everyone involved, they haven't gone unnoticed . . .</p> <p><b>The fourth volume of the laugh-out-loud LitRPG adventure series—a #1 Rising Star on Royal Road with more than three million views—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
