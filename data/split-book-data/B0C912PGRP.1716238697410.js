A battle for the fate of the Realms.</b></p> <p>On Midsummer's Eve, Emperor Illdrian, suspected madman and ruler of the Five Realms, will pass the scepter of power to a new heir.</p> <p>It should be me, Loghann Grenwyld, lost prince of the empire. I have fought tooth and nail to arrive in the High Plains before Drakkus, Lord of Chaos, usurps my rightful place as emperor.</p> <p>I have arrived with the magical priestesses of the realms and their armies at my back. If Drakkus thinks I’m giving up my right to the scepter without a fight, he’s got another thing coming.</p> <p>But he's not the only one who wishes to see me fail. The High Fae Queen, Everleigh—liege of the immortal realm—also wants my head on a platter.</p> <p>Order and Chaos united against me. Two paths, each calling to my power, each yearning for my destruction. To choose between the two would be certain doom.</p> <p>So I choose both Order and Chaos. I will rule it all.</p> <p>Why be an emperor when I can be a god?</p>";
