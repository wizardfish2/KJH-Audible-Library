But he can't afford to forget his enemies.</p> <p>The New Moon Coven and the Salem Coven have their sights set on Logan. After he humiliated them during the Greater Familiar Duel at Sinner's Field, they've been watching closely, waiting for a moment of weakness to get their revenge. Logan isn't sure what they'll try, but he knows they'll try something.</p> <p>Can Logan find new artifacts of power and improve his abilities through training and bonding? Will he find the Fertility Witch Mother Dearest and convince her to join his coven so that his witches can have children someday?
