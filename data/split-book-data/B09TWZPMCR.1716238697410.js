window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Would YOU love a monster girl?</b></p> <p>Tony Platz had the respect of his peers, a career on the fast track, and the body of an Olympian. There was only one problem: It was an open secret he carried a torch for his already-married partner. When a raid put her in the hospital and finally exposed her husband's ongoing infidelity, Tony got shipped out to Oolytau to keep him from doing something that wouldn't <i>just</i> end his career. As weeks turned into months, it became apparent the last person his crush wanted to see was the one man who could say \"I told you so\", and his future prospects with the NHIC looked grim.</p> <p>Tayra Manes had a dream. She worked hard, graduated the academy, and became the first of her kind to join the Non-Human Investigative Corps. There was only one problem: She was a griffin, and not everyone approved of her being allowed to serve in the previously all-human NHIC. Within 24 hours of her assignment to Oolytau, she had a bounty on her head, no place to call home, and a new partner.</p> <p>As a simple apartment hunt turned into a deadly game of cat and mouse, their problems multiplied as Tayra realized Tony might just be the dream she'd come to the city to find, and Tony found himself making the same mistake twice.</p>";
