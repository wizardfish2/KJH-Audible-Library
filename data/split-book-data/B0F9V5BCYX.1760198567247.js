Apparently, the rest of the world thought it would be a great time for an all-out nuclear war.</p> <p>Destruction was unleashed on such an incredible scale they say the very laws of physics changed. Now, massive mutants roam the city, looking for something—or someone—to eat. Violent gangs fight for control of the city's remains. Strange, human-animal hybrids are now part of our struggling societies. And perhaps strangest of all, magic is now real. Yeah, I'm still trying to process that one.</p> <p>But it wasn't all bad. A small society took me in and taught me to survive. They gave me hope for a future. In fact, I've decided to start my own settlement, and I'm going to use all that I've learned to make it into a fortress. I wasn't going to let something like nuclear annihilation get me down. I was going to survive, and maybe find a good woman or two to keep me warm at night.</p> <p>Or, you know. At least until the mutants show up. Then, it's time to fight.</p>";
