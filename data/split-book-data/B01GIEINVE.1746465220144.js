For the women of New Alcyone - women just like her, genetically reengineered and trained since childhood to be the most effective killers in the galaxy - this is a staggering loss. For the Independents, the rebels who captured her, this is a boon beyond measure. </p> <p>If they can figure out how to control her. </p> <p>Now, six years have passed since the events of Bellatrix, and for six years Sigrid Novak has been gone, vanished, with no sign, no word, and no trace. But all has not been quiet within the Federation. The Council for Trade and Finance has been murdered, assassinated, and the death toll among the Federation's ruling elite continues to rise. </p> <p>With every corporate enclave that falls, the legend grows. They call her the Night Witch. A champion to some, a nightmare for others. Wherever she goes, death is soon to follow. </p> <p>Then, in an abandoned CTF research facility - and after so many years lost - a woman awakens. Her name is Sigrid Novak. And she is very, very angry. </p>";
