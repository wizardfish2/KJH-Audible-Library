No, these are stone-age like tribespeople—three women whose tribe has been slaughtered by a Great Beast.</p> <p>They seek a Chieftain. One who can lead them into glory. One who can harness the power of the crystals and its magic-giving mists.</p> <p>But tribespeople are not the only creatures who live and breath in this strange future. Crystal-tainted monsters and far worse roam the lands, hunting their prey in the remains of what is now ancient civilization.</p> <p>If Ryne's second chance at life is to last more than a few days, he'll have to protect and nurture this new tribe from all who seek to harm it.</p>";
