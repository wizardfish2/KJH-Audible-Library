That’s exactly what makes her a Dragon Elite though. However, even if you’ve got angels on your side and fight for good, it doesn’t mean you’ll be successful. </p> <p>The Rogue Riders won’t stop until they’ve won - or they are put down. Can Sophia stop the evil riders while also not starting a war that ends dragons forever? Or will they be forced to fight until there is no one left?</p>";
