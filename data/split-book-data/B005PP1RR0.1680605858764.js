window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Maureen Johnson, the somewhat irregular mother of Lazarus Long, wakes up in bed with a man and a cat. The cat is Pixel, well-known to fans of the <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>The Cat Who Walks through Walls</i>. The man is a stranger to her, and besides that, he is dead. </p> <p>So begins Robert A. Heinlein’s <i>To Sail Beyond the Sunset</i>. Filled with the master’s most beloved characters, this compelling work broadens and enriches his epic vision of time and space, life and death, love and desire. It is also an autobiographical masterpiece—and a wondrous return to the alternate universes that all Heinlein fans have come to know and love.</p>";
