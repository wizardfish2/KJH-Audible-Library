But mixing in the bizarro world of the Ancient Gods has burdened him to the brink with the crazy, the inexplicable, and the just plain wrong. But he remains true to his mission. He must stop the Cleinoid threat to his universe. An impossible appearing task to be certain.</p> <p>Then Jon suffers an undeniably awkward setback. He is killed. GÃ¡war, the uber-powerful god of demons, smashes Jon to bits and then eats the little pieces. Bad day for Jon Ryan. Bad day for all our hopes. His friends struggle to go on, to defeat the Ancient Gods, but what seemed impossible before is now not even an acceptable pipe dream.</p> <p>Despirate to find a capable team, Sapale reunites with Mirraya/Slapgren, the Deft master-witch. Along with Daleria and Tono, they undertake the dangerous and problematic task of locating the alternate timeline Jon Ryan, EJ. They suspect he is able to kill the Cleinoid gods and are anxious to learn his secrets. But EJ is as challenging to deal with as always. Any help he might supply always comes at a price that is difficult to justify.</p> <p><b><i>Wrath of the Ancient Gods</i></b><b>, Book 4:</b></p> <p>Only Jon Ryan could make such a mess out of the afterlife. Almost a year into his battle against the Ancient Gods, Jon Ryan has little to show for his herculean efforts. The angry gods are surging viciously in our universe. No society can even slow their onslaught. In the Cleinoid universe, they've been stopped for reinforcing their brilliantly successful war in our home, but only just.</p> <p>Jon and his crew must attack the single most powerful and evil force in the realm of the Ancient Gods.</p> <p>The odds are astronomically against Jon. His enemies have never tasted defeat. His only advantage is the inconstant loyalty of a once-evil monster Cleinoid corrupted by Jon. And then, Jon decides to go to hell - literally. He will attempt to free from damnation the architect of Cleinoid evil, the master megalomaniac who might just be able to kill off his kin. But, if you plan is to go to hell and resurrect the worst guy who ever live, aren't you asking - begging - for disaster? Not if you're Jon Ryan, #fighterpilot.</p>";
