window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Benny White had been having a rough couple of years, and the approaching apocalypse wasn’t exactly helping.<br> <br> Pulled from the point of death and thrust into a horde-mode-style survival game, Benny’s odds weren’t looking too great. To make matters worse, an eldritch god… entity… thing named ‘Dave’ tasked him with destroying the very System that now controls his fate.<br> <br> But hey, it's not all bad news. Benny’s experience as a lab tech grants him a rare Splicer Class that lets him repurpose the genetic material of slain enemies into augments for himself. Bone claws, blood-bullet turrets, and maybe a skeletal hydra head or two are just a few of the additions to his gory arsenal.<br> <br> Then there’s his Flesh Golem summon, a six-foot mound of muscle and sinew called Meat. That lumbering monstrosity might come in handy, just as soon as it stops walking into trees…<br> <br> The stage has been set. The contestants have been chosen. The entire galaxy is watching.<br> <br> Welcome to the Game of Souls, where the only prize is to survive.</p>";
