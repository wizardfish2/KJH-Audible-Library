window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Change is the only constant, and not all change is good. The change most recent for Tristan Walker was all the free time he now had after finding his girlfriend in a compromising position with a few other people. He went back to his normal routine of life and had mostly forgotten the indiscretion when he found himself waking on his couch after a bright flash of light, with two suns hanging in the sky.</p> <p>Unable to stay in the snowy mountains where his house appeared, he must set off and find a new place to live in this world. And he might not have to do it alone either, as he’s not the only one from earth on this new planet. With a weird shop system that turns killed animals, beasts, and monsters into credits, there is a whole system worth of things to buy.</p>";
