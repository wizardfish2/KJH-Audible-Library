window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains books one and two of The Forever Series.</b></p> <p>Jon Ryan is irreverent, cocky, funny, and walks with a swagger. He says what he means, he says what he wants to, and, in fact, he says what needs to be said.</p> <p>The cocky fighter pilot turned astronaut is also Earth's only chance for survival. The planet Jupiter, thrown off orbit, will destroy Earth in less than a century. Jon volunteers for the most ambitious, desperate mission ever conceived: His consciousness must be transferred into an experimental android host, where he'll live an immortal - and lonely - life. Jon's only companion on his 50-year voyage is his ship's irritable AI.</p> <p>After successfully journeying for decades and locating a suitable human resettlement, Jon begins to discover the wonders life can hold, including the power of family and, for once, true peace. But no good deed, or good man, goes unpunished.</p> <p>The US president wants him dead and is willing to sacrifice his own people to eliminate Jon. An alien species has vowed a holy war to eliminate all humans, either on Earth or wherever they might run. Only Jon can protect humans from their enemies.</p> <p>With the best planet for colonization ruled by an ancient, malevolent species, there may be no hope for humans in a crowded galaxy. The limits of human technology may not be sufficient. The limits of Jon's endurance may not be enough. His endless enemies may prove to be unstoppable.</p> <p>Jon may have forever, but does humanity have any future at all?</p>";
