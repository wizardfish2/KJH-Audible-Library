window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Randidly Ghosthound built a Class with his own hands.</b></p> <p>Although he may now Level and rapidly earn rare Skills, the System isn't done with him yet. As the final hurdle to becoming accepted by the System, Randidly must lead a group of Zone 32's best into the Raid Dungeon and complete the assigned Quests. What starts as a simple horde survival mission becomes complicated when the Creature begins meddling again with his Fate.</p> <p>Yet as it turns out, not all threats to humanity are alien ones. Because in other Zones, stand-out heroes like Randidly Ghosthound don't exist to curtail humanity's darker impulses. In the divided remnants of the country's capital, some powerful figures have taken a few sips of the power offered by the System and like the taste. They'll experiment on the bodies of the poor and forgettable to find out how they can wield the power of monsters for themselves.</p> <p><b>Book 5 of the hit LitRPG fantasy series with over 50 million views on Royal Road.</b></p>";
