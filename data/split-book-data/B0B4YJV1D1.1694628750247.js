Frail and sickly, Yu is the only descendant of her mighty warrior lineage to live without strength, without purpose. She is a stain on the honor of her family, an embarrassment to her prestigious clan.</p> <p>Hidden away, Yu comes to live with the constant scorn and ridicule of her peers. She is bullied, beaten, and bloodied. But she is never broken.</p> <p>She dreams of one day proving herself worthy.</p> <p>Defying her father’s wishes, Yu trains with her twin Jian swords, using her flawless memory to perfect their complex forms. Working in secret, she builds her martial skills to a level unheard of for her young age. But her skills mean little without cultivation.</p> <p>Until she is given a chance—a chance to be reborn.</p>";
