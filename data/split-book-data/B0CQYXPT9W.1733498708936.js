It wasn't enough to be one of the gang's rising stars, or better lieutenants. He needed jail time, serious jail time—not that juvie crap or just going to county, to garner the respect he needed and deserved.</p> <p>Unfortunately, his bastard of a father, the same one who left his mother to die in poverty and him to run wild on the streets, took an interest. Seeing him sitting on the bench when his case went to court was a shock. But not as big a shock as being sentenced to ten years in the Imperial Navy.</p> <p>That's just the first of Chase's nasty surprises as he finds himself among the Emperor's Own—The Wolfhounds. How and why his bastard father sent him there is a secret that only the base AI knows the answer to. When that same AI decides to use Chase to fulfill its own orders, Chase soon finds himself in a situation where if he doesn't die honorably in combat due to the enemy, his own side will arrange those circumstances for him.</p> <p>Unfortunately for everyone involved, Chase is proving to be just as tough of a bastard as the man who sent him there.</p>";
