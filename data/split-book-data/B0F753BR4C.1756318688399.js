One of many people from Earth drafted by aliens to participate in \"the trials\" in order to gain \"ascension,\" he must now endure hazardous environments and hostile creatures, strengthening his physical and mental skills to superhuman levels.</p> <p>Fortunately, Walter has been gifted an Absolute Luck System, granting him the uncanny ability to achieve the statistically best possible result in any situation.
