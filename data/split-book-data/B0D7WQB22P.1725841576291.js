window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For the first time, books 1-6 of the popular series Solar Dragons Need Love, Too! have been bundled together. Pick up the catch-up collection today and support the continuation of this hilarious series full of memorable characters and exciting action!</p> <p><b>Being one of the only humans in Meteoropolis is tough. Thank goodness I'm also fused with a Solar Dragon.</b></p> <p>Taken from my old life with little memory of what brought me here, I wake up in a high tech capsule. A wrinkly old elf tells me that my soul is incomplete and has been fused with that of a Solar Dragon to give me a second chance at life. Where? When? An urban metropolis filled with fantasy races, erected atop the back of a giant asteroid. Meteoropolis. And millions of years in the future, to boot.</p> <p>But that's not all. I've got super powers, too. To add to the excitement, I end up hosted by an anxious unicorn elf named Pinky Peach who is basically a professional gamer girl.</p> <p>Add to that a feisty flower sprite and a hissfolk beauty who end up forming a curious truce based around me and, well, life in this strange city seems pretty interesting.</p> <p>But it won't be all unicorns and flowers. Dr. Luna wants me to use my rare draconic powers for good... You know, like a superhero.</p> <p>Can I handle my host, my Splice Partner, my new friends, and my secret day job? Whatever happens, I'll definitely be advocating for myself. Solar Dragons need love, too, you know.</p>";
