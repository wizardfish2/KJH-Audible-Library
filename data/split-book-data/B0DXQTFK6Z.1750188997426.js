window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Zane was done with fate. The Fates aren’t done with Zane.</b></p> <p>Ezekiel Zane’s once-quiet retirement has rapidly become very complicated. His long-dead wife has returned as a banshee, and a manic-pixie goblin girl is working overtime to turn his life upside down. To make matters worse, a half-slime federal agent wants in on the action.</p> <p>The Fates have other ideas.</p> <p>When the shadowy Office of Eldritch Affairs recruits Zane and his women to investigate a surge of supernatural activity and a rampage of rogue shifters, he must confront a looming threat that challenges even his formidable resources. To defeat it, Zane must assemble a new band of mercenaries: wily sorcerers, old friends, and sword-swinging celestials.</p> <p>Beset by bloodthirsty mutants and unexpected betrayals, the grizzled veteran must finally awaken all his old abilities, and potentially surrender what little peace remains in his life.</p> <p>Dark City Girls 2 is an urban fantasy set in the Demon Hunter/Fateforged universe.</p>";
