window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There’s something new, dark, and sweet at Old Ironbound</b></p> <p>Ymir made a vow to master magic and to take care of his women. To do that, he'll stay at the Majestrial Collegium Universitas, but he'll stay on his own terms. He has a new business idea that will make life at the college sweeter and keep all the scholars randy. Ymir’s new business scheme requires a kitchen girl: the flirty dwarf named Toriah Welldeep, whose cheerful smile hides a broken heart.</p> <p>It's not all work, though, and he finds love, laughter, and passion with Jennybelle Josen and Lillee Nehenna, though the elf maiden is struggling to come to terms with the short lifespan of her new family, and something is giving Jenny nightmares.</p> <p>Could it be one of the new professors working at Old Ironbound? The incoming teachers are not what they seem. Is the Midnight Guild coming to finish what they started?</p> <p>Barbarians don’t wait for assassins to murder them in their beds. Barbarians murder first.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer: </b><i>Barbarian Assassin</i> is a steamy slice-of-life harem adventure in a magic university on another world. The story burns slow and hot, as hot as the depraved women in Ymir’s life. The sex scenes are explicit. You’ve been warned. Enter a brand-new world from Aaron Crash, the best-selling author of the <i>American Dragon</i> series.</p>";
