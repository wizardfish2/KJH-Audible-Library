window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Ten thousand stars, once chained, taste freedom. An eternal empire, once undefeated, falls to pieces. An alliance, once united, now lacks a common foe. War was hard enough. Peace may be impossible.</i></p> <p>For 17 years, Colonel Henry Wong and the United Planets Space Force have fought the Kenmiri Empire. They drove the alien overlords back from humanity's borders into their own stars and found allies among the Kenmiri's slaves and subjects.</p> <p>Now the war is over. A great Gathering has been called of the allies who fought the war, but they only ever shared a common enemy. With the Kenmiri in retreat, a thousand new agendas are revealed.</p> <p>The United Planets Alliance wants peace above all else. Their allies want everything from new homes to new empires - and all too many of them are prepared to do anything to achieve their goals!</p>";
