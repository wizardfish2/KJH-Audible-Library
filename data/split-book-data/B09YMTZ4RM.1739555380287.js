This one seems more organized and has Rob scrambling to decipher their plans. Worse: they seem to know things about Rob that even he doesn't.</p> <p>This time freedom is on the line as these new criminals are more interested in convincing Rob to join them than in killing him.</p> <p>But Rob isn't the only one struggling with freedom.
