window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In September 2019, Max Morgan boarded a vintage Beech Twin aircraft with the five ladies from his office and the three-person flight crew for a flight to Sheridan, Wyoming. Max’s boss had scheduled a team-building exercise for survival training, so they had bags packed with camping gear, firearms, and ammunition.</p> <p>Then the aircraft hit a mysterious vortex in the air that pulled them inexorably toward the west at a dizzying speed. That vortex dumped their aircraft back in time in northern Germany 1,700 years earlier.</p> <p>How are Max, the six remaining women from his flight, and the two orphans he rescued going to survive as they help their Saxon neighbors try to survive Frankish raids and the coming Roman army?</p> <p>Warning: This book includes unusual relationships, descriptions of violence, slavery, and loose interpretations of historical events. If that’s not your thing, then please skip this book with the author’s blessing.</p>";
