window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>“And what exactly was it that you were attempting to summon, Lord Eamon?”</i></b></p> <p>On the day of his Proving, Apprentice Summoner Samuel Eamon chooses a white rabbit as his familiar, summoning a creature from the Outer Spheres and dubbing it “Snowball”. What he gets is a shapely succubus with bunny ears and a poofy cottontail.</p> <p>Turns out everything he tries to summon ends up a succubus. With his new Summoner’s License, Samuel is sent with a former classmate as his escort to meet Runescribe Elantrica Ilmora—someone who just might be able to discern the truth behind his odd spin on Calling Magic.</p> <p>There’s one more issue: This former classmate of his, now a nun, was his personal bully at the academy—and she’s irritatingly gorgeous. Now they have to put differences aside to get the job done, facing goblins, monsters, and the perils of the wilderness together. As a relationship develops between the pair, how will Samuel manage his nightly duties to his succubi in tandem with his complex feelings for his childhood bully?</p>";
