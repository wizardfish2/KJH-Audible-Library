window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fifth book in Seanan McGuire's funny and fast-paced urban fantasy InCryptid series, featuring ballroom dancer and monster expert Verity Price. </p> <p>Verity Price is back on the West Coast and getting back into the swing of the family business: cryptozoology. She's rescuing cryptids from bad situations, protecting them from monster hunters, and generally risking life and limb for the greater good, with her ex-Covenant partner/husband, Dominic, by her side. Her ballroom dance career is behind her - or so she thinks. </p> <p>When Verity gets the call from the producers of <i>Dance or Die</i>, the reality show she almost won several years before, she finds the lure impossible to resist, and she and Dominic are off to LA for one last shot at the big time. Of course, nothing is that simple. When two contestants turn up dead, Verity will need every ally she can find with the investigation, without blowing her cover.... </p>";
