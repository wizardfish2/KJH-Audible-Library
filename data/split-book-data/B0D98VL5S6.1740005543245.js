window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Big houses, peaceful streets, packed refrigerators and beautiful women. Did I mention magic, too?</p> <p>After years of clearing out the initial floors of dungeons so that famous teams could take the real prizes, I was around about ready to call it quits. But after getting myself dragged into the final floors of a legendary dungeon by a team of equally-legendary morons, I found myself as the only survivor – and the only one to claim the legendary prize on the dungeon’s final floor.</p> <p>Now I’ve got enough gold to put my feet up forever, and where else better to move than a luxurious magical suburb? I can relax, enjoy life and maybe even settle down with a few beautiful women.</p> <p>But being an overpowered warlock in a magical town comes with all kinds of hiccups; I need to keep my angsty demonic familiars in line, deal with the wood-nymph who’s squatting in my backyard, and keep a handle on the sheer number of quirky neighbors who seem to be intent on interrupting my peace and quiet.</p> <p>And to top it all off, there's the beautiful blonde mage living across the street and the stunning brunette living next door.</p>";
