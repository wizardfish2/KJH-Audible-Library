But… the world is still in shambles, survivors are fighting over limited resources, and he no longer has access to magical, gun-wielding minions.</p> <p>So, rest will have to wait.</p> <p>Drew needs to find a new way to control hordes of undead minions without his brain leaking out through his ears. Becoming an undead Lich is certainly an option, but that involves losing certain… <i>assets</i> that he’d rather hold on to, especially with him and Amber considering the option of having children. Which is nearly as daunting as the apocalypse itself.</p> <p>To further complicate Drew’s life, the gods of the multiverse have finally come to Earth, making deals and offering great strength to those who bend the knee. Meanwhile, other powerful figures are emerging, ones that Drew will not be able to face alone.</p> <p>When a new threat arises, one that seeks the extinction of the human race, Drew is forced to set aside his morals to focus on what really matters…</p> <p>Survival.</p>";
