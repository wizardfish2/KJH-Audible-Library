Despite my fate, I’ve always felt like I was destined for more.</p> <p>When a surprise journey to the elvish kingdom of Hamelin puts me in the crosshairs of scheming nobles, magical talismans, brutal orc hybrids, and ruthless brigands, I finally have the chance to prove myself.</p> <p>I won’t be facing it alone. With Fiona, my fierce yet adorably clumsy childhood friend, and Scarlett, my dangerously beautiful maid, I’ll show them all why a second son deserves to be feared.</p> <p>Because the power I’m building won’t just change me. It will change the world.</p>";
