The Multi-Versal System is still an asshole, still focused on blood and carnage, murder and treachery.</p> <p>They have three days to prepare for the beginning of a trio of Monster Waves to test the few that have survived. On top of that, the flora and fauna of the new world have been mutated and enhanced. Gideon, L'Sana, and Ari are not alone however. They made a deal and the remnants of the Shador are at their side. They have a City Stone and a few Gods in their corner whether Gideon wants them or not.</p> <p>Both L'Sana and he must deal with their choices of accepting Bloodlines and what that truly means while doing their best to create a new home for them all, one that will help defend them against what's coming.</p> <p>The Monster waves, the mutated beasts and flora, are nothing compared to the threat of their fellow survivors when the System itself pushed all towards killing. They were Scions of just one Elite Tutorial. There were five others, with a possibility of at least five Scions per, not to mention the machinations of Multi-Versal Factions and the Gods themselves. All eyes are upon Erebus, unique in the billions of years of Integrations in more ways then one.</p> <p>Gideon had no fear, nor ever had, and his eyes were a predator gaze locked upon it all, including the still vivid intent of making a Senator pay for the broken women he'd left behind.</p> <p>Rebecca Trumane, the Governor, and her lackey, the Fool, are also still out there with their own ambitious plans, creating the Mercenary Faction of the Unchained upon Erebus, gathering an army to push her to the apex.</p> <p>All of it is a maelstrom of chaos dancing on the edge of an Apocalypse in Book 2 of the Best Selling series, Nocturne.
