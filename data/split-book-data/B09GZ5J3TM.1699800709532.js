window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Being a mage isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Especially when you’ve witnessed the end of the world and the demise of all you’ve ever loved.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a particle physicist, William Jenkins is as unsuited to survival on an alien world as any normal 30-something post-doc could be. Thankfully, he’s not alone. With an AI, magic, scientific curiosity, and, most improbably, a deity on his side, Will must come to terms with his new reality before otherworldly terrors forever extinguish the light of hope on this new world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the forces of darkness amass to invade her home, Effni Naridia, Qaseri Ranger, and Guardian of her peoples, must face her own demons. By undertaking a trial, Effni could determine not only the fate of her city but unravel a mystery aeons in the making.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Last Physicist</i> features elements of progression fantasy and Gamelit and is perfect for those who enjoy stories by Andrew Rowe, Will Wight, and Andy Weir.&nbsp;</p> <p>Warning. This novel contains questionable quantum mechanics, general relativity, and magic.</p> <p>Note: This book also features profanity, vivid depictions of violence, pain, and gore, along with depictions of mental health issues (including PTSD, generalized anxiety, and depression) some listeners may find distressing.</p>";
