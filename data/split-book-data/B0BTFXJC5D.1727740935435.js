window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Hugo Award-winning first novel ever written by the bestselling author of The Chronicles of Amber!</p> <p>Conrad Nomikos has a long, rich personal history that he'd rather not talk about. And, as Arts Commissioner, he's been given a job he'd rather not do. Escorting an alien grandee on a guided tour of the shattered remains of Earth is not something he relishes—especially when it is apparent that this places him at the center of high-level intrigue that has some bearing on the future of Earth itself!</p>";
