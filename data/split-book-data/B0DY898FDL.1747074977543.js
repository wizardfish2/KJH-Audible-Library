window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The complete 4 book Cheer Girls series is available in this single Omnibus edition.</p> <p>Life can get wild sometimes! One moment I'm driving a bus full of cheerleaders back to their college dorms, and the next, the road vanishes beneath us, plunging us into darkness. When we awaken, we find ourselves in the wilderness of another world, guided by The Voice, a mysterious entity with immense power who brought us here with a hidden purpose. To fulfill his agenda, The Voice grants us powerful abilities and grants us quests that allow us to enhance these powers. Thanks to these newfound abilities, we manage to survive our first few days battling goblins, orcs, and even zombie football players.</p> <p>We soon settle in an abandoned village called Moondale, making it our new home. But the village walls can't always protect us, and soon we're fending off a horde of monsters trying to capture the cheerleaders. Well, not on my watch!</p> <p>However, our biggest challenge isn't the monster horde, but the betrayal of one of our own who has been corrupted by Lilith, Queen of the Succubi. Despite the overwhelming odds, we're determined to fulfill our destiny—the reason The Voice brought us here. And maybe, just maybe, once that task is complete, the cheerleaders and I will find a way back to Earth.</p>";
