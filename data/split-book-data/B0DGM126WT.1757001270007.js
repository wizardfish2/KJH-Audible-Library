Not only are my days spent enjoying my new home and the pleasant summer sunshine, but I get to do it all alongside Sophie, the stunning blonde mage from across the street, and Victoria, the beautiful demon-horned brunette lawyer from next door.</p> <p>Of course, giving back to the community is also on my to-do list. Using my Handyman Magic—and a little of my Arcane/Destruction when necessary—to help out with a few would-be magical DIY problems around town is putting plenty on my plate, as well as dealing with the wood-nymph who still calls my backyard home.</p> <p>Not only that, but when my girlfriends and I uncover the path to a pair of lost artifacts that would complete the new display we helped start at Emberfall Museum, it’s clear that we’ve got more work to do.</p> <p>This time we’re going to need a little assistance. Fortunately, Sophie’s dryad friend Eva has returned to town, and she’s more than eager to help...</p>";
