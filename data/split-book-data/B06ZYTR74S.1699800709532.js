window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the fourth and final book in speculative-fiction master Christopher G. Nuttall's Angel in the Whirlwind series, an epic battle pits the survival of hope against the locus of destruction.</b> </p> <p>As the Commonwealth produces more starships and increases recruits, victory begins to slip from Theocratic control. This can only make the Theocracy more desperate to win...and more dangerous to fight. </p> <p>After a mission to liberate an occupied planet ends in nuclear devastation, Kat Falcone - now a commodore in command of HMS <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> - sees firsthand just how far the enemy will go. Suddenly dealing with the war effort <i>and</i> a humanitarian crisis, many in the Commonwealth want a truce. Kat wants something else: to crush the Theocracy outright - and quickly. </p> <p>Kat devises Operation Hammer, an all-out assault on the enemy home planet, Ahura Mazda. It is a bold and risky plan, but the enemy has revealed there can be no middle ground. Can Kat break the galactic stalemate and deal a death blow to the Theocracy? As two empires prepare to fight the largest space battle in history, Kat must trust her instincts to save her people and avoid oblivion. </p>";
