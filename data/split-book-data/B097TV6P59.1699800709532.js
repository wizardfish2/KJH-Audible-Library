His day job bores him, and he never seems to be able to meet his family's expectations. The only escape he's ever had is his love of MMORPGs.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when he becomes the subject of a test without even knowing it, he's transported into a game-world called Eloria with no escape. It's a frequent daydream of his; however, in none of those dreams did his wife and daughter ever accompany him.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, Dave must balance protecting his family with exploring his dream...oh, and trying to stay alive. Monstrous beasts roam Eloria; worst of all, an undead army led by the vile Death Knight.</p> <p>He'll have to adapt fast and learn to cooperate if he hopes to make a new home for his family.
