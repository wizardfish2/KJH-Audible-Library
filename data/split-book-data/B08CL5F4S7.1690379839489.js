window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>(Minor spoiler and warning at the bottom of the blurb. Please read all the way through.)</p> <p>Sameerixis, or Sam for those who actually know him, isn’t what you’d call normal.&nbsp;</p> <p>He had been a door-to-door salesman of sorts. One who peddled wares, wishes, and whims to anyone willing to pay his prices.&nbsp;</p> <p>Except that life is gone now.&nbsp;</p> <p>His old business model had been modernized. Email, phone contacts, letters, flyers, business cards, and scheduled consultations.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sam was a man trapped in place by his own success. And loving it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, he was also the owner of a private military company that specialized in dealing with criminals or those wanted by a government.&nbsp;</p> <p>His goals were simple. Rebuilding his strength, establishing a comfortable life for himself and others, and taking from Jenaphila as much as he could.&nbsp;</p> <p>As he works to complete those objectives though, Sam’s going to run up against some of the biggest players in any of the planes.&nbsp;And make enemies out of more than a few.&nbsp;</p> <p>Everything is changing faster than Sam would like it to. Heading right toward what might just be the end of the prime plane itself.&nbsp;</p> <p>Warning: This novel explores dark subjects and what people will give up of themselves, and each other, to get what they want. The main character is written as a demon from another plane in a tough situation and will not make choices that line up with societal and cultural norms.&nbsp;</p> <p>It contains adult themes and moral ambiguities.&nbsp;</p> <p>As with my previous work, explicit scenes are found within. It has violence and a harem relationship.</p>";
