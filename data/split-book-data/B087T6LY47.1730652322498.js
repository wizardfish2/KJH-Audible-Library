I'm from Ruddock, Ohio, and I'm just about 50 percent unqualified to save the universe from the slavering demonic hordes of the super evil bitch queen Lilith.</p> <p>But just when I thought things were starting to look up...</p> <p>My companions and I arrive in Tagimron, the sphere of discordance. It's a hellscape on wheels, and every aspect of this claustrophobic and grimy world is intent on tearing my companions and I apart. Our only chance of resisting corruption and failure is to hold fast to the bonds that unite us, the love and faith that keep us strong.</p> <p>But Tagimron is a world designed to exploit our greatest weaknesses, to weaponize our fears, doubts, and traumas. As perilous as our foes may be, the greatest danger in this sphere may very well be ourselves.</p> <p>Wish me luck. We're all going to need it.</p> <p><b>Warning and minor spoilers: </b><b><i>The Manifold</i></b><b> is an 18+ book intended for mature listeners.
