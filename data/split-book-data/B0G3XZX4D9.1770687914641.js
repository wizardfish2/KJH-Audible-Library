When the old girl finally gave up the ghost in the middle of nowhere, I wasn't expecting to get a tow from an alien mothership. But the next thing I knew, me and my buddy Mike were halfway across the galaxy in an oversized hubcap full of the weirdest space creatures you ever did see.<br> <br> Turns out aliens are mighty friendly folks, but they can't fix their tech to save their lives. Didn't take long for us to put our know-how to good use, fix a bunch of gizmos, and make a load of friends, but I was still eagerly countin' the days 'til they'd drop us back in sweet home Alabama. That is until I met Piper Skyflare—a pretty little green-skinned lieutenant in the Martian Sky Force, with knockout curves and a right hook to match.<br> <br> With Piper to hold my hand and Mike to hold my beer, I'm making the most of this cosmic road trip. It's a wild ride, but one thing's for sure—a sense of humor and a roll of duct tape can get you through darn near anything. That and coffee. Lots of coffee.<br> <br> No Stress Space Express<i> is a story about finding your true family, told with the common-sense wisdom of Jerry Boyd's </i>Bob and Nikki<i> series </i>(Bob's Saucer Repair)<i>, and the low-stakes world building of Travis Baldree's </i>Legends &amp; Lattes<i>. Join Rusty and his crew for a heart-warming, laugh-out-loud adventure with no tension, and no drama. Just good clean fun, great friendships, and a little romance too.</i></p>";
