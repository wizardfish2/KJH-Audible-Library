window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dhane kicked the bucket in spectacular fashion, every bone crushed, every organ popped against the full force of a 40-ton garbage truck speeding through a red light.</p> <p>The only part of him intact—whole—entirely unaffected by the grisly affair was his soul. Souls are durable things, you see, like kids: they bounce.</p> <p>And bounce he did, into the abyss between worlds, drifting until one excited soul watcher fished him out and found him a new home, a heaven for gamers and nerds and everything in between.</p> <p>It was all he could have ever wanted in the afterlife, down to choosing his class, killing mobs, and exploring a beautiful fantasy world chock full of mysteries yet to be discovered.</p> <p>At least…it would have been those things if that first day had gone a little tiny bit differently.</p> <p>Instead, he now finds himself locked in the middle of an eternal conflict between Light and Shadow—humans and monsters—potentially being the enemy to all.</p> <p>Wrong Divinity is the start of a new GameLit series that balances comedy with serious themes. It's an isekai—a portal fantasy—to the spirit realm. Join Dhane, our underdog, as he explores his new world, a world full of unique characters, RPG mechanics, and spiders—ugly, terrifying spiders—while he learns what it means to be an Arachnomancer.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
