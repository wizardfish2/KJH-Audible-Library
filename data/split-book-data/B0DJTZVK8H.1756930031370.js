Living on earth as a recent college graduate, he can still perfectly recall his past life on Albion, a sword and sorcery world. He'd been hailed as the \"Hero of the World\" after crawling his way up from poverty, eventually enjoying great fame and luxury.</p> <p>But on mana-starved Earth, he's just a guy. His parents need his help, and finding a new job would be more trouble than it's worth. However, when Earth is suddenly attacked, changing the natural laws of the world and threatening all life on the planet, Max will get a new opportunity to regain some of his lost power...and then some. He discovers an entire system of multi-dimensional colleges created for those gifted with a Path.</p> <p>The universe is much larger than Max had even known ever during his first life. Max is not the Hero of Albion anymore, but the drive to excel is still part of his nature. And the more power he has, the easier it should be to save his world.</p>";
