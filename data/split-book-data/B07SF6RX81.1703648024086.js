Only they didn’t know it.</p> <p>Six months ago, Connor learned what the alien race that populated New Earth feared - a mysterious enemy who nearly brought about the collapse of an entire civilization. To help the colony prepare for this new threat, Connor rejoins the Colonial Defense Force.</p> <p>Using alien technology, Connor opens a gateway to another universe hoping to learn more about the threat. Instead, he receives a colonial distress beacon. Six months ago, they’d left people behind on a mission, all presumed dead. The beacon might be them, or it might be a trap, but Connor will not ignore the call for help.</p> <p>Fearing the beginning of another war, the colonial government would rather do nothing than risk bringing attention to the colony, but it’s already too late. The colony stands upon a crossroads. Its future is uncertain. They’ll have to adapt if they’re to survive.</p> <p><i>Vigilance</i> is the seventh book in the bestselling First Colony series.</p>";
