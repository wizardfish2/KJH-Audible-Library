window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A killer cyborg endeavors to get a life . . . of sorts . . . in the second installment of this action-packed LitRPG spin-off of the Faceless Minion series.</b></p> <p>Not long ago, NSLICE-00P—short for Non-Standard Leashed-Intelligence Cybernetic Enforcer—performed her job with cold, calculated, merciless obedience. When she was ordered to destroy something, it got seriously destroyed. Unfortunately, that led her to take out her own creator before he created her, casting the cyborg out of her reality and into a world of magic, levels, and skills, with her very own dungeon core and no one to tell her what to do.</p> <p>As it turned out, fate put NSLICE-00P in the right place at the right time: she's become a legit heroine in this new existence. Not that glory matters to her; she has work to do. Like building her own personal army of cyborg creatures both animal and elemental. Because when she finds a new commander, she wants to be sure to show them her best side—which is pretty much the worst for anyone in her way.</p> <p>But first NSLICE-00P will have to face off against those who want to know exactly where this cute-but-deadly armored knight came from, what she's really after, and how they might use her lethal gifts for their own sinister ends . . .</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than two million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
