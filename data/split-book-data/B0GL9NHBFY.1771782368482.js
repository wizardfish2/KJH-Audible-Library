window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Wynn Tunnicliffe had been all set for an awkward couple of weeks away on a retreat run by a professor he loathed in the middle of the El Dorado forest. Bags packed along with a healthy dose of cynicism.</p> <p>And then the world changed. Wynn was whisked off to a dog-eat-dog tutorial, where things did not go well. Battered, broken, and left for dead, he was reforged into something new. A Wyrmblood, the first of his kind. Filled with anger and fury at what was done to him.</p> <p>Dropped back where he was plucked from, this new monstrous version of Wynn will have to fight for his life, the resurrection of a new friend, and the futures of the other retreat participants.</p> <p>Opportunities abound. Power, security, love, and family. Even a bit of revenge. None of that comes for free in this new world. It will need to be paid for in blood and violence.</p> <p>But wrath is something Wynn is well-suited to unleash.</p> <p>(Trigger warning. This series contains an anti-villain protagonist who often chooses to take advantage of situations rather than fighting for what most would consider right.)</p>";
