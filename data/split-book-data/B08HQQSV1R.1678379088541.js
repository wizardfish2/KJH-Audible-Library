window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A village full of gorgeous elves desperate to be loved? There had to be a catch.</b></p> <p>Sebastian Frost’s most recent memory was waking up in a field naked, in a body that wasn’t his own, in a world that definitely wasn’t his own, and three stunning pointy-eared women staring right at him. He also remembered hair as white as starlight, eyes like amethysts, and the name Shalia.</p> <p>Fortunately, it was the right name to know.</p> <p>Shalia was the elves’ goddess, and that made him her herald. If that wasn’t enough of a blessing, he was in a game world, he was high level, he had hundreds of ability points to spend, and the elves were practically throwing themselves at him.</p> <p>Of course, there was a catch.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shalia, her followers, and now, Frost himself were viewed by the world as bringers of misfortune and everybody hated them. Although, to be fair, Frost was going to rain misfortune on anybody who attempted to harm his lovable new followers.</p> <p><i>Herald of Shalia</i> is a fun fantasy litRPG by Tamryn Tamer and contains attention-starved elves, beast-girl courtesans, foul language, twosomes, threesomes, and foursomes, and completely over-the-top love-making. You've been warned.</p>";
