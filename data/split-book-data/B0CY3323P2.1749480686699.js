window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 2036, an eccentric billionaire funded humanity’s first trip to Mars as an ego project. That expedition made the most significant discovery in human history: proof of extraterrestrial life. The ancient alien outpost they found catapulted humanity’s knowledge of faster-than-light travel, genetic engineering, and planetary colonization forward by centuries.</p> <p>Almost a century later, humanity has shown that despite their use of advanced technology, some things haven’t changed. Greed and xenophobia still run rampant amongst the stars, and wars are common between humanity’s dozens of extrasolar colonies.</p> <p>Kayden is a recently discharged military pilot, just trying to make his way in the big universe. Fortunately for him, he’s about to stumble upon humanity’s next great discovery–one that could have an even more profound impact on the course of human history than finding the Mars outpost.</p>";
