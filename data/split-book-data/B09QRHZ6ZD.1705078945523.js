Defeating the Burgon Beast should’ve been the end of it, but it was only the beginning.</p> <p>Beating the next boss monster that invades Earth will only stave off the Collapse, not prevent it. The future devoid of all life but a single Pyre proves that. Jacob refuses to accept that future. He’s done playing their games. Even if he must walk through the fires of despair and glory to be rid of them.</p> <p>Back in the past, the Gnawing Hunger roams free, monsters run unchecked between the shards, and abominations of unfathomable power lurk beneath the surface of Lormar. Otherworldly beings pull the strings behind Pyresouls, twisting the challenges Jacob faces at every turn to exploit his weaknesses and thwart his progress.</p> <p>Trapped between two timelines, having lived a second life he can’t remember, can Jacob find the dark truth behind Pyresouls and uncover the secrets of Lormar’s demise, or will he leave the future a grave and Earth a long-rotten corpse?</p> <p>Or somehow, something even worse?</p> <p>With leveling and gear progression mechanics, <i>Futures Grave</i> is the second novel in the best-selling LitRPG series Pyresouls Apocalypse.&nbsp;</p>";
