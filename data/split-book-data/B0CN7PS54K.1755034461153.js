With every challenge that arises, my beautiful family meets it with open arms. Now that all my secrets are out in the open, I finally feel as though my life in Gelderham has truly begun.</p> <p>That doesn't mean everything is smooth sailing, though. Between Krulnoth's reappearance, drama related to the Heart System, and even some crises involving the System Saints themselves, life in the Borderlands is never boring. But as I address everything that comes at me as pragmatically as possible, I begin to worry about the other consciousness deep inside meâ€”how much of the Dark Lord yet remains in the deep recesses of my soul? What could bring him out once more?</p> <p><b>One thing's for sure: I'll do whatever it takes to make sure that doesn't happen. The only thing that matters now is doting on my wife and daughter and protecting this community I've grown to love as my home.</b></p>";
