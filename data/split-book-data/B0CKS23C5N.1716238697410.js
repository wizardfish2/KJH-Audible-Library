window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One great series in a single offering!</b></p> <p>My life wasn't that exciting; a degree in engineering, a small flat in London, and an ex-girlfriend who still texted me when she was drunk. Every day was a bore.</p> <p>Everything changed when I found myself in Lanercost, a small medieval village, with no idea of how I arrived. The locals seemed friendly, and a chance encounter introduced me to several breathtakingly beautiful women. I decided to make the best of it. Armed with only a solid education, my wit, and the five pennies in my pocket, I decided to build a life here. No, not just a life; a House that would last for generations. A kingdom. I was going to conquer.</p> <p>Of course, there were a few things I had to deal with before I could become king: some ghosts, the local constable who hated my guts, and that whole lack of money thing. Oh, and a freakin' dragon.</p>";
