window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Moving into a rundown Victorian house with a vampire living in the basement isn’t as bad as I thought, but things go from weird to weirder when a badly injured gnome collapses in my back yard.</p> <p>The surprising part? It’s my friend Nin’s long-lost grandfather.</p> <p>Since he’s unconscious, we can’t figure out who’s chasing him or where he’s been all these years, but if we can’t help him, he’ll die.</p> <p>To make matters worse, there’s a new dragon in town. A female dragon. Everyone knows females are more dangerous than the males, and this one takes an instant dislike to me. It seems that she wants to date my mate, Zav, and has his mother’s approval.</p> <p>If I can’t avoid her wrath and find a way to cure the gnome, Nin’s going to lose her grandfather, and I’m going to end up deader than the vampire in the basement.</p>";
