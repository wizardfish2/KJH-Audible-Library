window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ashe, a child of five years, woke to screams of his fellow villagers and animal growls. Terrified, he asked what was going on, but his mother grabbed him and fled their village with his father in hopes to escape the lizardmen that were raiding it.</p> <p>They weren't fast enough. After a plan was made up to split up and meet in a cave not too far away, Ashe's mother rushed towards that direction. Ashe felt better because they were losing the lizardmen, but she tripped and found that her ankle was at an odd angle. His mother cried out for Ashe to leave her as she couldn't continue on, but he was defiant to her pleads. He finally obeyed his mother and fled as fast and as far as his little legs could carry him, but he wasn't fast enough.</p> <p>Ashe is saved and brought to another world by The Goddess of Light's High Priestess and her knights. He ends up with a new name, new identity, and a new family.</p> <p>This is a story that has magic, sword and sorcery, and some litrpg elements, but is definitely not heavy with it.</p>";
