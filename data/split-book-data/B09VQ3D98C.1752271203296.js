Until exposure to a powerful mutating agent gives him super strength, passive-regeneration, and the ability to use powerful weapons. </p> <p>The downside? Lots of other people have mutated as well, except they’re insane and want to eat everyone.</p> <p>After he’s recruited by Cloud Nine Engineering, the most powerful corporation in Dios, Grant is labeled “Hallowed” - the fancy name for his new mutation - and drafted into a war against the Mutes, the cannibalistic mutants overrunning Dios.</p> <p>The deal is simple. In exchange for risking his life to fight monsters, Cloud Nine will provide him with the cure that keeps him from becoming a monster himself.</p> <p><b>Experience the start of a pulse-pounding military sci-fi series, set in a post-apocalyptic world, from T.E. Bakutis. It's perfect for fans of Nicholas Sansbury Smith, T.W. Piperbrook, and Bobby Adair.</b></p>";
