window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Drafted into a private army, he must fight monsters or be hunted as one....</b></p> <p>A century after the Break destroyed much of the world, the wealthy island nation of Dios stands alone as a paradise for those that remain...so long as they aren’t poor and homeless.</p> <p>For street orphan Grant Riven, life is a series of kicks in the face. Until exposure to a powerful mutating agent gives him super strength, passive-regeneration, and the ability to use powerful weapons.&nbsp;</p> <p>The downside? Lots of other people have mutated as well, except they’re insane and want to eat everyone.</p> <p>After he’s recruited by Cloud Nine Engineering, the most powerful corporation in Dios, Grant is labeled “Hallowed” - the fancy name for his new mutation - and drafted into a war against the Mutes, the cannibalistic mutants overrunning Dios.</p> <p>The deal is simple. In exchange for risking his life to fight monsters, Cloud Nine will provide him with the cure that keeps him from becoming a monster himself.</p> <p><b>Experience the start of a pulse-pounding military sci-fi series, set in a post-apocalyptic world, from T.E. Bakutis. It's perfect for fans of Nicholas Sansbury Smith, T.W. Piperbrook, and Bobby Adair.</b></p>";
