Will the Unseen Emperor of Riverfarm make that distinction, however?</p> <p>A reckoning is coming as old faces and new reemerge. And all the while, The Wandering Inn is still serving food and respite and even plays to adventurers and Antinium alike. But something is coming from the dungeons. And it—<i>they</i>—are hungry.</p>";
