window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Quantum Hughes doesn't know how long he's been trapped in a cyber noir world known as The Loop.</p> <p>For each day that passes, Quantum adds an item to his inventory list, hoping that he'll one day be free.</p> <p>Has it really been nearly 550 days? Has he gone mad? Will Quantum ever be free?</p> <p>A surprise message from the real world sparks a series of events that Quantum could never have never imagined. Suddenly, he's facing off against killer invaders, fighting steam-powered robots, going toe-to-toe with dagger-wielding goblins, visiting floating realms, and even taming a mirrored dragon.</p> <p>Through Quantum's trademark snark, his near bottomless inventory list of items (example: item 287, King Tut's dagger made from a meteorite; item 327, a Viking helmet with horns), there's no telling what he will do next, or how far Quantum will go to level up and solve a challenge.</p> <p>About the series: Explore vast and unique fantasy MMORPG worlds in one of the original isekai GameLit series published between 2015-2018. The Feedback Loop is a portal fantasy series by Harmon Cooper, Amazon best-selling author of <i>Pilgrim</i>, Cowboy Necromancer, and <i>Monster Hunt NYC</i>. Fans of role playing games and everything from classic noir to high fantasy and fast-paced gamer action will love this new collection. Watched <i>Boss Battle</i>? You'll dig this. A fan of <i>Sin City,</i> <i>Sword Art Online</i>, <i>The Punisher</i>, <i>Free Guy</i>, or <i>Ready Player One</i>? This will scratch that itch.&nbsp;</p> <p>Quantum Hughes has always been one of narrator Jeff Hays' most beloved character voices. Volume 1 features Jeff's re-recording of the book that started it all. This new version captures a more developed Quantum voice, and takes advantage of better gear and mastering. Soundbooth Theater has also remastered Books 2 and 3, and recorded a bonus Feedback Loop short story and Quantum's inventory list, so even longtime fans will have a reason to pick this improved version up.</p> <p>Grab it, and dive into The Loop!&nbsp;</p>";
