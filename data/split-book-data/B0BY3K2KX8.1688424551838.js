window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In a world full of superpowers, Felix had a pretty crappy one.</b></p> <p>He has the ability to modify any item he owns and to upgrade anything. Sounds great on paper; almost like a video game. Except that the amount of power it takes to actually change, modify, or upgrade anything worthwhile is beyond his abilities.</p> <p>At least, that was until Felix leveraged a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give himself a great deal of points.</p> <p>Investing in, owning, and using Super Heroes and Super Villains, Felix built up an empire: an organization by the name of Legion.</p> <p>Felix has brought it into the world once again, hiding it behind the name of the \"Association,\" a neutral party he's building up to walk the line between the Guild of Heroes and League of Villains.</p> <p>The foundation for all his plans is now in place. The time has come to branch out into becoming a global power—a power that governments can't touch, nor would they willingly want to.</p> <p>It's time to push Legion right into the forefront of everyone's mind without them ever realizing what they are looking at. Legion will operate from the sidelines while controlling everyone.</p> <p>There is no way Felix would let go of this chance, nor would he even consider the possibility of failure. Kit and Lily are going to come home, and Felix is going to make it happen—regardless of whatever government or organization might try to get in his way.</p> <p>Legion First.</p>";
