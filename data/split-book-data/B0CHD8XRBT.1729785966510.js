window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Develop my team, dive the dungeons, and don’t ever stop.</p> <p>I’ve always wanted to conquer the Big 5 dungeons ever since one of them took the life of my father nearly fifteen years ago. Nobody ever said the Path of Progression was easy, but my burning desire to dive can’t be quenched. I just never thought I’d be prohibited from getting a diving license just because I tried to help a bratty blonde girl get hers.</p> <p>Soon, we’re joined by a lovely brunette bookworm, and we start diving the dungeon on our own terms. As it turns out, I have a few abilities that greatly increase our chances of actually finishing the Path, leading to a life of fame and luxury. Others soon notice the power I’m building though, and they’ll do anything to stop us.</p> <p>I will conquer the Path of Progression with the help of my stunning companions.</p> <p>That is unless the dungeon, or my secret enemy, kills me first.</p> <p>This story contains action/adventure sequences, stat sheets for the main characters, and some slice-of-life elements.</p>";
