window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The four rules of freelance villainy are as follows:</p> <p>1. Always wear a mask</p> <p>2. Never hurt civilians</p> <p>3. Never kill the heroes you’re paid to fight.</p> <p>4. And the bad guy always loses.</p> <p>And even with the rules, there's plenty of challenges to being a villain or hire. Belligerent heroes. Rival villains. Taxes. But one thing I never imagined I’d be handling was finding out I'd gotten one of my gorgeous villainess lovers pregnant.</p> <p>Which comes at not a great time, seeing as how I'd just offed one of the biggest villains in the world. Now his seat in the Guild of Villainous Foes up for grabs, and every bad guy with a death ray and an ego is crawling out of the woodwork to try and take it. Which means there aren’t a lot of heroes looking to hire a costumed punching bag.</p> <p>But even worse is that everyone expects ME to be cooking up an evil scheme to end all evil schemes! Because if I don't, the consequences will be dire. And I'm not even getting paid for it! All of which leaves me with only one option: fail harder than I’ve ever failed before.</p> <p>Unfortunately for me, not even losing is going to be easy this time.</p> <p><i>Villain for Hire</i> is a hilarious adventure through the world of heroes, superpowers, love, and villainy. With mad schemes, hammy bad guys, psychically compelling yandere villainesses, and mad AI, this men's adventure is sure to delight.</p>";
