One last chance at life, in exchange for unquestioning completion of tasks set by the system that brought you back. </p> <p>At first, Dare's assignments seem trivial, inconsequential even. But as the missions progress, they produce more questions and no answers. Unexpected assailants, inexplicable tasks, and too many people Dare knows already in the system. Dare's never believed in coincidences. </p> <p>SC's motives are unclear. Questions aren't tolerated. Punishment is meted out arbitrarily. And SC can terminate the contract, and all participants' lives with it, at any point in time. </p> <p>Dare's only chance is to figure out how to fight back without being deleted in the process. </p> <p><i>Rise</i> is a Gamelit dark contemporary science fiction story set in the near future and is the first book in the Last Chance series. It touches on death, the afterlife, torture, and the lengths people can be pushed, too.</p>";
