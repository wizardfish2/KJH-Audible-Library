Life begins at 70.</b></p> <p>Running on the world's fastest quantum computer is a very special game: one where retirees leave their flesh-and-blood lives in search of endless adventure. Weapons, spells, gold, experience points.... These are the marks by which life is now measured.</p> <p>Ethan Crane wants none of it. In fact, he never wanted to retire at all, let alone play a game for all eternity. But now he's on a mission to find his wife - a wife he just discovered is still alive and inside the game.</p> <p>Nothing will stop him from reaching her. Not even himself.</p> <p><b>Buy the three-book boxed set today to listen to John L.
