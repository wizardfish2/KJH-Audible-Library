A legendary lover of women of all sizes, shapes, and fantastical species, he has long since retreated into the comfortable lifestyle of a traveling musician, making more peaceful uses of his talents...and he has <i>many </i>talents.<br> <br> With the help of his pixie companion, a beautiful elfmaid, and a buxom half-satyr, Bodrick is in for his most pleasurable adventure yet, finding himself tangled up in a bitter feud involving two proud noble families. Manticores, maidens, and music abound in this sexy fantasy romp!<br> <br> And, fair warning: the \"spice\" is very frequent.</p> <p><b>Content warning</b>: <i>The Bawdy Ballads of Bodrick the Bard</i> contains explicit depictions of adult situations, over-the-top humor, purple prose, and song lyrics that'll make you laugh or cringe (or both). It also features *cough* \"unconventional relationships\" (wink wink nudge nudge). This book was cowritten by two incorrigibly indecent authors who are a bad influence over one another. You have been warned.</p>";
