Not until their home is invaded by soldiers trying to steal it and a strange boy telling her the world as she knows it will be wiped out in a fiery dragon war - unless they work together to stop it. Meanwhile, there's a different voice whispering to Trinity, calling to her, telling her what to doâ€¦because the dragon in her egg is not ready to give up without a fight.</p>";
