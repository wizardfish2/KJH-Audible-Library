While Reina, an accomplished monster hunter, was overjoyed to be reunited with the man she loves, what would happen if she found out that he was actually one of the largest monsters in history?</p> <p>Torga’s plans to reveal himself are interrupted when a conspiracy of other gods sends him and his wife to Helheim, a frozen waste where their skills and magic are stripped away. He’ll have to recover his powers, and possibly make a deal with some of Helheim’s less savory residents to escape, but will Reina accept his help once she realizes who he really is? He’s going to have to convince her, because her mortal body is dying, and if it does, she’ll be trapped in Helheim forever.</p>";
