window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The third book in the best-selling Chronicles of St Mary's series which follows a group of tea-soaked disaster magnets as they hurtle their way around History. If you love Jasper Fforde or Ben Aaronovitch, you won't be able to resist Jodi Taylor.</p> <p>History happens all around you. And, occasionally, to you.</p> <p>I could have been a bomb-disposal expert, or a volunteer for the Mars mission, or a firefighter, something safe and sensible. But, no, I had to be an historian.</p> <p>It began well. A successful assignment to 17th century Cambridge to meet Isaac Newton, and another to witness the historic events at The Gates of Grief. So far so good.</p> <p>But then came the long-awaited jump to the Trojan War that changed everything. And for Max, nothing will ever be the same again.</p> <p>With the bloody Battle of Agincourt playing out around her, Max risks everything on one last desperate gamble to save a life and learns the true meaning of a second chance.</p>";
