Full of equal parts action and laughs, this story is a satirical take on the typical LitRPG Apocalypse stories blended with elements of </b><b><i>Pok√©mon </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Monster Rancher</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p><b>About the Series: </b><i>Join Basil as he progresses from Level 1 to 100 all while refusing to play by the rules of the System.
