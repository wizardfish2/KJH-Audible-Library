window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If you like fire-breathing giant creatures, dark elves reigning absolute and unchallenged, money-grubbing dwarves, and powerful dragons - you can find them in <i>Transformation</i>. </p> <p>The familiar world collapsed overnight. As the Transformation progressed, disasters occurred throughout the Earth. Materials changed their properties, new species of flora and fauna appeared. The Game converted our world into a huge dungeon, completely replacing the previous civilization. </p> <p>However, the alien plans for Earth began to go awry from the very beginning. The conversion was less successful than expected. An ordinary young man stole the bonus for the first gaming action, depriving the invaders of their perk. </p> <p>How can Yaroslav manage this situation? Which aliens will become his ally? Which ones are his enemy? Dare they rebel against the all-powerful invaders, regain their land, and even create a new world? </p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater team for this production: </p> <p>Justin Thomas James - Narration, editing, mastering <br> Jeff Hays - Ollie, Ellir, and Dar Kroo <br> Aurelia Vazquez - Eva, Heiro Kamir and the rest of the female cast <br> Dalton Lynne - Proofing, Guest Voice <br> Ahmed Mahmoud - Music</p>";
