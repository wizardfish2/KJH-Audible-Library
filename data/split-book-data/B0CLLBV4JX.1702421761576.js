They live among the human realms, waiting for their moment to strike.</p> <p>Prince Gray, heir to the throne, has discovered these shapeshifters. Stopping this hidden force will require alliances with creatures beyond the edge of civilization: a secluded tribe of beastkin women.</p> <p>The all-female tribe exists on the edge between human and animal. They are powerful, but they are nothing compared to the threat of the shapeshifters.

Someone like Gray: a man with the ability to bond to the beastkin. In exchange for protection, he'll receive power.</p> <p>Together with these alluring non-humans, Gray seeks the truth behind the monsters and the origin of the strange powers he wields.</p>";
