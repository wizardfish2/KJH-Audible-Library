Conquer the System.</b></p> <p>When Miraâ€™s home is destroyed by gods, she makes two requests to the System that sends her to another world: to be sent to an isolated forest where she can avoid the violent path to godhood, and to gain magic that helps her live and thrive in the forest.<br> <br> She is granted both, though in the harshest way possible.<br> <br> The System strands her in a dangerous forest where half the plants are poisonous, the rivers teem with souls, and even the smallest beasts lay waste to experienced adventurers. <br> <br> To survive such perilous conditions, she uses her modern knowledge of botany and chemistry to create clever traps and weapons, all while learning powerful magic and combat skills alongside her fiercely loyal cat.<br> <br> Nobody believes she stands a chance. But in a world where the system rewards those who overcome dangerous challenges, the forest is a gold mine.<br> <br> And while most people would give up, Mira realizes something that surprises her...<br> <br> She enjoys it.</p> <p><b>Experience the start of this unique spin on Apocalyptic LitRPG Adventures. Botanists who choose to get teleported into dangerous jungles are very rare and if Mira can survive, she may just become indispensable to the System itself.</b></p>";
