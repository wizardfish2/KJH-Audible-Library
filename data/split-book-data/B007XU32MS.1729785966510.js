window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Robert A. Heinlein is widely and justly regarded as the greatest practitioner of the art of science fiction who has ever lived. Here are two of his greatest short novels: </p> <p><i>Gulf,</i> in which the greatest super-spy of them all is revealed as the leader of a league of supermen and women who can’t quite decide what to do with the rest of us. And <i>Lost Legacy,</i> in which it is proved that we are all members of that league - or would be, if we but had eyes to see. </p> <p>This collection also contains two great stories, a pair of the master’s finest: one on the nature of being, the other on what it means to be a man.</p>";
