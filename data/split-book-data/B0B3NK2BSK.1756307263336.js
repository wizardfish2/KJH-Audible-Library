Fairytales would have you believe he lived happily ever after, but life doesn’t always match up to fairytale endings.</b></p> <p>Accidentally murdered by a cleric in another universe during a botched resurrection, Arnold, a semi-pro gamer turned clerical error, has now become a thorn in the vindictive Northern Regent’s side. To make matters worse, he has a giant stuck in his well, and the adventurers’ guilds are pounding on his door for the chance to kill it (which is more than a little annoying, as all Arnold wants to do is focus on taking his trap method wide while he builds a farm to give down-on-their-luck farmers like him a chance).</p> <p>However, there is “one” little problem with his plan: changing the world isn’t easy, and Arnold needs an entire industry that doesn’t currently exist.</p> <p>And resource management is hard.</p> <p>And trying to find good employees is difficult.</p> <p>And Blackwood doesn’t have the infrastructure to support all these people (even if he does).</p> <p>And the regent is out for blood and trying to ruin him.</p> <p>And no matter what he tries, the giant won’t die.</p> <p>And for some reason, Ranic wants him to find a goal that gives his life meaning.</p> <p>So let’s see how well his happily ever after really goes…</p>";
