In a plot to steal his business, his greedy partner and greedier fianc√©e tricked him into taking the \"long sleep\": suspended animation for 30 years. </p> <p>When he awoke in the far different world of A.D. 2000, he made an amazing discovery. And suddenly Dan had the means to travel back in time and get his revenge. </p> <p>Once again, the author of <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> and <i>Starship Troopers</i> displays his genius. <i>The Door into Summer</i> proves why Robert Heinlein's books have sold more than 50 million copies while winning countless awards and earning him the title of Grand Master of Science Fiction.</p>";
