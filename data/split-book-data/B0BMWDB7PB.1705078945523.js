The demands only escalate as many of the academy's faculty hint at an exam that is far more dangerous than anything the mage and his friends have experienced before, passing or failing depending on their very survival.&nbsp;</p> <p>Monsters, undead and shadowy enemies are just the beginning as something sinister pushes Dax and the Academy to the brink of collapse.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Card Mage: Silent Society</i></b><i> </i></p> <p>After the harrowing events of their previous year, Dax and his fellow students spend their summer trying to relax before returning for their third and final year at the Kinarth Academy of Champions.
