I took nothing but the clothes that I wore, the wooden sword that I had carved myself, and a sharpened piece of flint. I didn’t have a cloak to sleep in until later, when I had worked enough to have a few coins buy one. In fact, I didn’t even have a name. I was an Adventurer Monk, a novice, trained by my father and grandfather, but now on my own. Now I have a village, a place that I call home, and two women. And the girl called Harmony. I also have a war to start. There are Kobolds in the orchards. And Harmony’s sister, Delilah has become their self-appointed queen. Unfortunately, she has vowed to destroy both the village and my father-in-law’s farm that supplies all the food for several of the villages around us. I can’t let her do that. Her minions are man-eaters, and I suspect that Delilah has eaten that meat as well. I have two wonderful, beautiful, highly sexual women, and now Harmony is with us as well. She is my third. If I am to protect them, Delilah and all of her Kobold monsters must die. I have a war to start. And then I will finish it. Me and my three beautiful, loving, and very deadly mates. We Adventure as one. I am a Monk. A Swordsman. Valeera is my healer, lethal in her knowledge of anatomy and how to take life as effectively as she is able to preserve it. Dawn is the Huntress, the bowman. A long range precision marksman. And now Harmony, the Shadow. They are a perfect family for me. I make it sound like we are some ruthless death machine, and when the situation requires it, we can be. But I would rather make people’s lives better, happier, laughing and caring and being generous with neighbors more than fighting a war. Especially this war. I wish that there were another way. There is no other way, but I can at least hope that it will be short. The girls like to be loved, and so do I. We have a lot to learn, both as Adventurers and as lovers. And I would rather focus on the later. I will. Soon. When my war with the Kobolds is over. We’ll laugh and visit with friends and tell jokes and wear comfortable clothing and wake up in a nice bed after a day of swimming at the river or in some spring. Soon. This afternoon though, I have a war council to attend. Just myself, my companions, and my in-laws. It is enough. I’ll sit down at the table and make a plan. Right now. And then we’ll do something more pleasant and more entertaining. I am looking forward to that. Soon. Warning…or perhaps enticements: The story of Ronin’s Adventures are filled with monsters, killing, bandits, martial arts, philosophy, magic, elves, mating rituals, emotional turmoil and baggage and past wounding…and a lot of sex and casual nudity. Ronin’s clan has a tradition of having more than one mate, so that’s where the sex comes into it. His story doesn’t shy away from the graphic details of any of it. It’s an adventure story for mature adults. A vicarious romp with heroes, nymphs, and pixies. Maybe you will enjoy it. Writing it was certainly a lot of fun. This is BOOK 2.";
