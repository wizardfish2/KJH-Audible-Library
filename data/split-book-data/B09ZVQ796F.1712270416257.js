But one of the hunters is missing, and Van, along with his growing crew, knows where to look. Climbing up into the rarified air of the super-rich, Van uncovers a new enemy: The Fade.</p> <p>And they are as cruel as the stars are many. A gang of heartless killers, the Fade will stop at nothing in the name of profit, which is fine with Van, as he’ll stop at nothing in the name of justice.</p> <p>Tracking his quarry across a dozen systems, Van, Torina, Perry and Icky—along with Zenophir, the new technician—will untangle a conspiracy of betrayal and death. As Van soon discovers, the Fade never lose.</p> <p>But they’ve never met Van and his crew.</p>";
