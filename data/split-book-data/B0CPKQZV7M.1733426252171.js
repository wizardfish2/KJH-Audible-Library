window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Magically transformed into a hat, a wizard must endure being worn by a dwarf questing through a labyrinthine underworld, in this comical fantasy adventure.</b></p> <p>Answers and vengeance are so close that Absalom Scryne can almost taste them. Perhaps if his consciousness had been transferred to a pair of shoes instead of a hat, he would've had the necessary tongue to do so . . .</p> <p>Having made it through the Badlands by the skin of his crooked yellow teeth, Ig the kobold celebrated the achievement by blowing everyone up. Now, separated from the unhygienic scalp of his apprentice, Absalom must navigate the pitch-black underworld—traversing a miners' strike, a dungeon complex, a dragon's lair, and the domains of creatures best described as eldritch—perched atop a dwarf.</p> <p>But will they make it back to the surface? Will we ever see sweet, stinky Ig again? What has the circus got to do with anything? Discover all this and more as the adventure continues!</p>";
