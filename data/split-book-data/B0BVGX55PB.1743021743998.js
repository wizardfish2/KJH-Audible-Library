A hole that I could never seem to fill.</p> <p>When I accidentally turn a coven of witches into nightmares, I find out what that something is.</p> <p>Magic.</p> <p>And it turns out, I have a crap load of it. As a latent power awakens deep inside of me, I’m exposed to one of the most powerful and corrupt organizations in the magical world—the Mages’ Guild.</p> <p>Barely knowing a spell from a few swear words and luck, I won’t be able to evade them alone.
