window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sean had been through something close to hell - he’d taken out Klein Denmur and Knight Evan Sharpeyes, along with a few of Lord Truestrike’s servants, but Chastity and Lilly died on the fields outside the city. At the end of that battle, he claimed Helga Helsdottir, soul-bonding her and renaming her Helga Oathsworn. With a Valkyrie by his side, Sean hoped never to lose another loved one to death. His enemies were far from done with him, however.</p> <p>Attacks on the association and their families started, claiming lives and hurting Sean’s friends. Finished with just trying to live his life, Sean made plans to take on his enemies directly. The turning point came when Sean confronted Denmur and his group outside the Golden Lion. Helga struck down Denmur’s champion, Knight Mithrilarm, during the ensuing duel, causing Denmur to snap. The fight left Denmur, plus dozens of others, dead. Even that wasn’t the end - the corrupt guards in Lord Sharpeyes’ pay arrested Sean and Helga.</p> <p>As they were brought before Magister Amuret, Sean discovered just how far he’d pushed his enemies when he was attacked and killed in the courtroom. Death could not stop Sean while he had energy to invoke his gifts from the Tuatha. Pushing death away, Sean got back to his feet and killed the guards and magistrate who had tried to murder him. He was brought before the unusually reasonable chief magistrate, who found Sean innocent of any wrongdoing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sean’s bond with Helga gave him access to new planes, including the Bog. That was where the souls of Sean’s foes now went if they died while in combat with him. In an effort to find out more about who was directing the attacks against him, Sean paid a visit to the dead in the Bog. He was determined to end the troubles facing him, even if it meant finding a noble solution.</p>";
