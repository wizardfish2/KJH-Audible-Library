And to her surprise, she discovers she isn't exactly human and may have an infinite number of siblings! That revelation broached many questions since Sam grew up an orphan on Earth.<br> <br> Unfortunately, Sam doesn't have time to dwell on what she has done to herself because the church has finally found Nara's whereabouts and immediately attacks the group, only to find out what an angry Pathfinder who only recently ripped an evolved creature apart can do.<br> <br> Join Sam as she laughs, battles, drinks, and stumbles her way across Hallista in this next installment of the Arcane Pathfinder series. Watch as she handles things her own way, no matter what is thrown at her. Her way may not always be the right way, but it's certainly the most entertaining!<br> <br> This book features a raid event, a seductive elf, more bandits, a wild night, epic battles, quick battles, lore galore, an ancient succubus, camping, exploring, loot, an ancient dungeon, and, of course, Sam blowing herself up...multiple times!</p>";
