To make matters worse, an eldritch god… entity… thing named ‘Dave’ tasked him with destroying the very System that now controls his fate.<br> <br> But hey, it's not all bad news. Benny’s experience as a lab tech grants him a rare Splicer Class that lets him repurpose the genetic material of slain enemies into augments for himself. Bone claws, blood-bullet turrets, and maybe a skeletal hydra head or two are just a few of the additions to his gory arsenal.<br> <br> Then there’s his Flesh Golem summon, a six-foot mound of muscle and sinew called Meat. That lumbering monstrosity might come in handy, just as soon as it stops walking into trees…<br> <br> The stage has been set. The contestants have been chosen. The entire galaxy is watching.<br> <br> Welcome to the Game of Souls, where the only prize is to survive.</p>";
