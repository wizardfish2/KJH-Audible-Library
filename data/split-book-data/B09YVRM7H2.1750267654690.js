He now personally hands out justice to any and all he comes across.</p> <p>Warner has been using his powers considerably since then. Cutting down all who would stand before him and attempt to stop him in his personal crusade.</p> <p>The price he had to pay for such a power cost him his life. He was forced to the point of giving all of himself to redeem the original holder of the right of Retribution, Warin.</p> <p>Warner was quick to pay that price.</p> <p>His effort was paid back to him in triplicate when Warin willingly passed the mantle to him. Giving all of what he was to Warner, effectively ending his life.</p> <p>Now Warner is the holder of the rights for Vengeance, Retribution, and Redemption.</p> <p>Each power has recognized him and responds willingly, allowing him to blend all three of them with growing mastery.</p> <p>Long gone are the days of being sick after utilizing them.</p> <p>Now the only concern Warner faces is the correct usage of those powers and when to use them.</p> <p>The world is an ever-shifting gray area that gets murkier by the year.</p> <p>The great change that’d been on the horizon is now upon the world. A change that will cast the entirety of existence into shadow or bring it back to stability.</p> <p>A reckoning no one wished for has arrived.</p> <p>The very world stands on the edge of a knife, waiting to see who will prevail.</p>";
