They require quests and accomplishments that simply don't exist in the world. Some say the World Law itself is broken and that the world is falling apart.</p> <p>In comes Sam Hastern.</p> <p>His family has been cursed by one of these classes for the last 50 years. No one has ever managed to level it, condemning them to the lowest paying jobs and life in a barren village.</p> <p>The class is called Battlefield Reclaimer.</p> <p>There's one more little problem.</p> <p>Sam's about to have it even worse, when a dungeon exploration leaves him looking distinctly non-human.</p> <p>In this work, you'll find leveling, crafting, experience-based progression, rare classes, evolving classes, and strange races.</p> <p>The world runs on mana crystals, beast cores, spirit veins, alchemical pills, and enchantments. The environment is hostile and filled with monsters and elemental storms.</p>";
