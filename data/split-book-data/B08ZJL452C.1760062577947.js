window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Buckle up - this is another crazy ride!\"</p> <p>The Scrapyard Ship sci-fi \"cliff-hanger\" adventures continue with <i>HAB 12</i>, the second book in the series: </p> <p>Captain Jason Reynolds faces new challenges, not only on Earth, but from the far side of the universe as well. The only way to stop the Craing this time will be to square off with them on their home turf. </p> <p>Jason's been informed that three powerful Craing warships, having similar technology as The Lilly, will soon be en route to Earth. The Alliance must destroy the Craing's wormhole means of distant space travel to avert Earth's total annihilation. Unfortunately, there's no way to reach the Craing worlds in time, at least not through conventional means. </p> <p>It's up to Jason and his hand-picked assault team to traverse, by advanced phase-shifting means, through the hazardous environment of HAB 12. This is an adventure fraught with carnivores of a Jurassic Age magnitude, and a terrain so deadly that turning back may be their only hope of survival. </p> <p>Note from the author: <br> Don't be surprised by cliff-hanger endings. I'll do my best to keep Scrapyard Ship, as well as the Tapped In series books, coming so you wont have long to wait for the next book. Enjoy!</p>";
