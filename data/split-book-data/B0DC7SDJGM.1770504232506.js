It always does.</p> <p>Before her brother kicked her through a magical portal that eventually landed her in nowhere Tonopah, Nevada, he called her an agent of chaos. But let's be fair. Our Scarlett doesn't create problems.</p> <p>Her magic just attracts it in all shapes and furry sizes.</p> <p>Like her familiar, Runeclaw. The black cat's tongue is as sharp as his nails, and he has a snark that can cut through just about anything.</p> <p>This time though, trouble was already here.</p> <p>The small town Scarlett wound up in is already home to a conspiracy or two, along with a dark magic hidden in the shadows. Perfect for Scarlett and Runeclaw in the worst possible ways. Maybe her brother had a point.</p> <p>Nah. It's just another coincidence. Right? What plans do the dark forces of Tonopah have in mind for our motorcycle-loving witch? Want to find out?</p>";
