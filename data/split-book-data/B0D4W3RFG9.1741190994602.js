No heroes have fallen into the spike pits. No one's come to admire the menacing d√©cor of skulls and warnings written in blood on the walls. Nothing!</p> <p>So what's a last boss to do when no one's good enough to challenge his dungeon?</p> <p>Why, build a party himself of course!</p> <p>But after recruiting a neurotic but pretty alchemist and a trigger happy beastkin huntress, he'll find that there are enemies outside the dungeon too. Ones whose appetite for competition is small, and who can't wait to serve him up on a silver platter.</p>";
