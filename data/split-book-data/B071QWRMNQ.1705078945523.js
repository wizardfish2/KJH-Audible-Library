window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Part-time heroes. Full-time outlaws.</b> </p> <p>Carl Ramsey has done the unthinkable: he turned down a lucrative job. When the deed is too despicable even for outlaws like the <i>Mobius</i> crew, someone nasty had to be behind it. Carl and his friends decide to hunt down their potential employer and turn him over to the authorities. But as amateur vigilantes, they mire themselves in a moral quagmire of conflicts of interest. </p> <p>With victory (and a tidy payday) in their sights, can they live with the awful truth they uncover? Carl will have to decide if being one of the good guys means letting a friend pay for their crimes. </p>";
