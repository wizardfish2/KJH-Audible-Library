Lucky for me, I can harness and multiply the elemental powers of my wives. Oh, did I forget to mention them? Each of my wives has an elemental affinity that grows stronger the more we bond, and so I’m well on my way to mastering all the elements.</p> <p>But I’ll need more wives, higher stats, better gear, and a kingdom to rule. Call me lazy if you want, but not even a long to-do list can stop me from relaxing in the hot spring between dungeon runs.</p>";
