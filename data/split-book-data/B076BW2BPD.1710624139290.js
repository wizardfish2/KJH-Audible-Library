window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Monster of Karth has risen once more. Quin Tern of Azbar has met his fate, and his council has borne the price of crossing Raz i'Syul Arro. Now, as the cruel walls of the city fade into the winter storms at his back, Raz rides north, seeking to take the High Priest Talo Brahnt up on an offer he never should have refused. The path Raz has chosen, though, is a bloody one, and before long he and his new companions find themselves pitted against hardships they can neither anticipate nor ignore. As man and snow and beast alike rise up to block their path, it seems almost as though the North itself has woken to wage war against the Monster. </p><p>And yet, Raz's greatest challenge still looms ahead. Far to the north, like a plague beneath the trees, Gûlraht Baoill, Kayle of the savage mountain tribes, leads his armies further east with each passing day. He has set his hungry gaze upon the reaches of Cyurgi' Di, the High Citadel, and desires nothing more than to see it razed from the face of the world, offering it and its blasphemous \"false-prophets\" up as sacrifice to his Stone Gods. Syrah Brahnt, the High Priest's adopted daughter and protégé, has found him out, discovering his plan to lay siege to her home, cutting her and the rest of the Laorin off from the world. As it is, though, there is little and less that she can do, and when the first of the Kayle's generals reaches the base of the mountain pass, Syrah is left with only one option. In the end, she will have to face the wrath of the tribes herself.... </p><p>Little does she know that the Monster is coming, riding hard to lend her his blades. </p><p>Book three in the critically acclaimed The Wings of War series. </p><p>The Wings of War: </p><p>Book One: <i>Child of the Daystar</i> </p><p>Book Two: <i>The Warring Son</i> </p><p>Book Three: <i>Winter's King</i> </p>";
