And just in time, because enemies are gathering.</p> <p>A war for control of the planet is brewing - one that would devastate dragon and human alike!</p> <p>The Mage assassins are no longer content to hide in the shadows. Their day has arrived, and they will rise to remake the world into a place without dragons.</p> <p>First they will need to contend with the Steel Dragon, either by drawing her into their web - or killing her. Kristen has proven herself a hard target to take down, again and again. But when offered a choice between the survival of humanity and dragon kind, how will she choose? Blood or family?</p> <p>Maybe she'll pick neither. Maybe Kristen will elect to forge her own path, to make her own destiny. But if she does, she will face opponents from both sides!</p> <p>That's okay with her.</p> <p>But she'll need every ally and friend she's met if she's going to unravel the centuries-old schemes finally coming to fruition and stop the war before it can kill everyone she's ever loved and destroy the world in the process.</p>";
