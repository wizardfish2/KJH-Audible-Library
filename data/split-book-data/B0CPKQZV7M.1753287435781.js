Perhaps if his consciousness had been transferred to a pair of shoes instead of a hat, he would've had the necessary tongue to do so . . .</p> <p>Having made it through the Badlands by the skin of his crooked yellow teeth, Ig the kobold celebrated the achievement by blowing everyone up. Now, separated from the unhygienic scalp of his apprentice, Absalom must navigate the pitch-black underworld—traversing a miners' strike, a dungeon complex, a dragon's lair, and the domains of creatures best described as eldritch—perched atop a dwarf.</p> <p>But will they make it back to the surface?
