Some Families want to bind me. Some still want me dead. And someone's seeking to unleash an ancient power, long sealed in shadow and bringing only war, death, and madness in its wake.</p> <p>This semester, surviving midterms might be the least of my problems.</p> <p><i>Warlock: Book Three</i> continues the magic school series with more danger, deeper bonds, and a coven that won’t back down.</p>";
