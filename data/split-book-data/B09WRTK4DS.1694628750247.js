It will take all of his considerable power to keep from burning everything to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Don't miss the start of the next great Fantasy LitRPG Series by Seth Ring, author of <i>Nova Terra</i>. Pre-order your copy today and explore a world whose secrets have been buried under decades of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>About the Series: Mixing slice-of-life with epic fantasy action, mystery, magic, cultivation, and a broken game system that seems determined to make everything as hard as possible for the already overpowered protagonist, this LitRPG/GameLit series is perfect for those who enjoy exploring rich worlds and complex characters.</p>";
