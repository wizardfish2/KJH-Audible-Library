Are they potential allies or a new threat? No one can tell, but fortunately, Clarke’s team includes Sammy Eloise: a slime girl with a fondness for video games, cosplay, and poisoning anyone who gets in her way. They’ll need all her shapeshifting talents if they’re to unravel this latest conundrum!</p> <p>But time is running out because dark forces are on the move. The Academy of Silence has dispatched a hunter to the region, and his arrival ushers in a deadly game of cat and mouse for Clarke and the women he loves.</p> <p>But who is the cat, and who is the mouse?</p> <p>The Academy hunter is an ancient vampire, trained and equipped to dispatch any foe—including blood knights! But Clarke is hardly defenseless; his skills have been honed, his team is ready, and magical boons have transformed him into a powerful weapon against evil.</p> <p>The stage has been set, the battle lines drawn, and soon these two men will meet in a clash that will shape the future of the entire world.</p>";
