window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Betrayal.</p> <p>Fresh off their escape from the doomed Yarasi outpost, Major Kal Zeris and the girls—Ash the fiery bounty huntress and Miranda the loyal fleet officer—limp to the rendezvous with Captain Ellis and the Stormrider. While the Dowd plot to sabotage the peace may have been exposed, an even deadlier threat lurks within the very heart of the Dominion.</p> <p>And the key to understanding it—and perhaps thwarting it altogether—now lies with the beautiful Yarasi warrior slowly dying in Kal’s sickbay. Without her help, there may be no hope of unraveling the truth...or stopping a deadly insurrection that threatens to shatter the Dominion and plunge the entire Tartarus Cluster into war.</p> <p><i>Insurrection</i> is the second installment in the Lost Fleet series, an action-packed male power fantasy harem in the spirit of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, Mass Effect, and<i> </i>Star Trek (the good version).</p>";
