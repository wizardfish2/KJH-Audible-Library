That might've been a little bit hasty.</p> <p>Our hirsute hero really stepped in it. Like, is on the verge of losing his dukedom and everything he's worked for stepped in it.</p> <p>The only way out? A little-known technicality that stops Senate proceedings and sends Montana off on what's most likely an insurmountable quest. One where odds are good that he'll either die without a respawn or accidentally commit treason against the Empire.</p> <p>Neat.</p> <p>Can Montana stop the Dark Queen's army on his own and hold the line for Glaton? Will he do enough to save Coggeshall from the aristocratic vultures circling? And will he finally find the sword of the gods he lost on his very first day in Vuldranni?</p> <p><i>Of Slicing Men</i> is The Good Guys at its finest: gory battles, surprise tactics, and unexpected heroes. Come for the long-term campaign play and rich character progression. Stay for the stupid banter and crazed, demonic inch worms.</p>";
