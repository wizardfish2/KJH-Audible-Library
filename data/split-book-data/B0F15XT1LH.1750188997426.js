Hello the surface, hello the new and old friends!</b></p> <p>Derek Smith, the real-life fantasy dwarf (who's also a cool dude!) finally conquered the mine-turned-Dungeon. Finally, it's time to take a step to the surface and see the new, changed Earth! With a seemingly impossible goal in mind—reviving a Fairy Princess isn't a simple task, after all—he would need all the help he could get. The first step is to befriend the people of the nearby Neo Village. Thankfully, he already has their bravest hero in his pocket . . .</p> <p>With his smithing, magical powers, and unlikely allies, Derek is going to start a new page in his journey. The only problem is—neither him nor his companions quite understand what is truly at stake. Not yet . . .</p>";
