window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John Doc Henry had been on the shortest, crappiest end of the stick since the first day of his life; no parents, bad foster parents, and abysmal luck at every turn.</p> <p>The day his life changed started out exactly like he had come to expect. His car died on a rarely traveled road, and he broke his toe shortly after dodging the one other car on the road. When it stopped and backed up to him, the license plate read “LADYLUK”, adding insult to injury.</p> <p>Now, he has a new name, a new life, and a purpose. The odds are still stacked against him, but the newly-named Doc Holyday has Luck herself on his side. With newfound confidence, he's ready to face the strange new world he has been sent to; a world similar to the “Wild West”, but with magic and supernatural creatures.</p> <p>(This book contains adult situations, including but not limited to: sex, gambling, abuse, drug use, harem, and murder. It also contains graphic sex scenes, which portray elements of BDSM. You’ve been warned.) </p>";
