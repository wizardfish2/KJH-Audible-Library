But the power he won came at a cost.</p> <p>He saved a world. He might have damned his own.</p> <p>All across the globe, incursion rifts split the sky, flooding Earth with Awakened invaders from distant worlds. Cities burn. Alliances crack. And Earth’s defenders race to seal the breaches—before the next city falls to ash.</p> <p>Terry doesn’t have time to feel guilty. Not when the System has given him a new Quest: assemble a full Master-grade skill set and rise in rank. He needs to grow faster, fight harder—perfect what he’s copied and steal what he hasn’t.</p> <p>The Systems think Earth is just another piece on their cosmic board.</p> <p>Terry’s done playing by their rules.</p> <p>It’s time to break them.</p>";
