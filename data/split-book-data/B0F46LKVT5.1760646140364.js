window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hello there, friend!<br> <br> I see that you've returned to Sunhampton, the cozy town where the beers are always cold and the pies are delicious. But you aren't here for an ale and a snack, are you? You're here for some artificeryâ€”and you're just in time.<br> <br> Lewis, one of the town's few artificers, was recently working on a routine job at Sunhampton School when he stumbled upon old enchantments in the basement. Enchantments that confound even an adept-ranked artificer like him, and will need some creative thought and clever use of skills to break.<br> <br> But that isn't all.<br> <br> It is commonly said that an artificer's work is never done, and Lewis finds himself with more enchantment and disenchantment riddles than he can keep up with. The question is, with the next ranking in his artificery class within reach, how quickly can he solve them?<br> <br> Join Lewis in the sleepy, sunlit town where he spends his days crafting and his evenings with his friends. Allow yourself to escape, just for a while, to a town where you're always welcome.</p>";
