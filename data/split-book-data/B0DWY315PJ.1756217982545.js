Nobody expected one to return.</b></p> <p>I was just a simple blacksmith apprentice when a visit by the mages of Essalin confirmed what I’d long suspected—I could touch the aether. Destined to be a mage, I’m plucked from my village alongside a feisty redhead so we could journey to the fabled city of the high mages to learn how to control and wield the aether.</p> <p>The road there isn’t going to be easy though. Brutal orc raiders are spreading across the continent for the first time in a hundred years, and rogue mages are stirring chaos in their wake. I find some allies along the way, including a highborn blonde with a sassy mouth, but it’s clear to me that I’ll need all the help I can get.</p> <p>Especially when my coming shakes the foundations of the entire continent—all the way to the long-dormant throne of the High Mage King itself.</p> <p>I hope they’re ready for me.</p>";
