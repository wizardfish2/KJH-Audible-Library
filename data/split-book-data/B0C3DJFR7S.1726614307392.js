As a member of the prestigious Black Dragon sect and the disciple of the infamous–and possibly mad–sect leader, she is in the perfect position to finally achieve her goals. </p> <p>Yet despite her newfound abilities and enviable status, the sect holds challenges and dangers far greater than anything Yu faced in her rural home. Her sect is a brutal place–where power rules all. </p> <p>And such power can create monsters. </p> <p>Thrust into the spotlight–Yu once more finds herself the object of disdain and prejudice. She is a competitor to be crushed, a verger girl daring to rise beyond her station, unworthy of the gifts she has been given. Her enemies are everywhere, and they will stop at nothing to see her fail.</p> <p>Despite the many daggers aimed at her throat, Yu must climb her way through the ranks of her new home, grow her cultivation, and reveal the true depths of her power.</p>";
