window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Wounded, abandoned behind enemy lines, left for dead…</b></p> <p>Ajax is one of Earth’s most elite, a Paladin pilot, and trusted to fly the most advanced starfighters humanity ever produced. His carrier and the rest of the fleet have fallen back, the recent damage from the elven betrayal making it impossible to stay in the fight. He knows they’ll return, and they’ll treat this world to the same kind of plasma bombardment that the elves had inflicted on Mother Earth.</p> <p>The real problem for Ajax, though, is that he’s parachuting down onto it now, his arm broken. He’s got no ship, and only a few months’ worth of hazy memories, after losing them to the purge. He’s got no damned weapons, only the most basic memories of survival training, and absolutely no clue about the planet beyond what he can see floating down. This is going to be a hell of a fight to get back into orbit, but he’ll do it—or he’ll die trying.</p> <p>They say humanity is only three meals from going feral… it’s time the rest of the galaxy found out just how true that is.</p>";
