Whatever that is. It involves the mind control collars, but creating an army of menial servants seems less than ambitious. And if there's one thing that Camus and the Veil have in plenty, it's dark ambition.<br> <br> Amber is using her infomancy to try to track down leads, Snow is working on figuring out the collars' magic, and Maddox is upgrading and repairing Dusk Runner so Scarlett can take the motorcycle back into battle.<br> <br> <b>They have one lead, but the sand is ticking out. The tracer they'd placed on Kingston Trane will expire soon, and it only leads to the location of the next Veil atrocity.</b><br> <br> However, Scarlett has always been good at getting into trouble. This time, the trouble will be the biggest yet, culminating in a final fight that she'd better be sure she'll win.<br> <br> <b>What she doesn't know is going to try to kill her. Camus has been preparing for years.</b><br> <br> Can Scarlett and Runeclaw survive? As options dwindle, it seems less and less likely. But a wise person never bets against a witch, her cat, and her crew.</p>";
