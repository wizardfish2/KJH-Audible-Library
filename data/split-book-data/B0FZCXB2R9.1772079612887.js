And also pie.<br> <br> With baked goods and coin as his new life goals, he turns to the competitive business of trading the random junk adventurers loot every day.</p> <p><b>Follow Balthazar as he does everything to find a baker... except leave his pond, because exploring the dangerous world out there is for suckers. Witness how adventurers just can't seem to stop dying around his home. And cheer for a crab who makes great new friends by simply buying them.</b><br> <br> <b>What to expect from this story:</b></p> <ul> <li>Silliness. Lots of it. The story doesn't take itself too seriously, so you shouldn't either.</li> <li>The only kind of OP here is how \"overpriced\" the crab's deals are.</li> <li>A system simple enough for a crab to use, but still conveniently complex when necessary, for some odd reason.</li> <li>Proper realistic adventurers: they are not very bright, and they make very poor decisions.</li> <li>No harems, not unless they're a harem of gold coins.</li> <li>Did we mention there will be pastries?</li> </ul>";
