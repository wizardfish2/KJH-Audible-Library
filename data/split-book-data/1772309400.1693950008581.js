He wanted to be dead. But Jon wakes up in the far future with an alien burrowing in his chest for salvage. Someone was going to pay for this. Check that. Lots of people were going to pay for this. Jon was the first astronaut to download to an android host to find the population of doomed Earth a new home. But that was so long time ago. He is now literally lost in time.</p> <p>The far flung future is dominated by an unstoppable species, the Adamant. They have conquered most of the galaxy. No civilization has successfully resisted them. Brutally efficient, selflessly devoted to their empire, and callous to all other forms of life, the Adamant have advanced without boundaries. But they are about to run into a major problem. One very pissed off Jon Ryan stands in their way. He escapes their prison ship, rescues two teenage shapeshifters, and intends to protect them at all costs. Jon, Mirraya, and Slapgren race across the galaxy always just one step ahead of disaster. But the combined evil forces that pursue them tear the trio apart. The teens must fend on their own in a hostile universe. All the while, Jon runs for his life, hoping against all hope to locate the teens. In a galaxy burning with war, genocide, and hidden magic, can Jon Ryan pull of one more miracle?</p> <p><i>Flames</i>, Book 2:</p> <p>For Jon Ryan, it always seems to be the hard way. But he likes it like that. When he finally wins, it's all the more satisfying. A cataclysmic fight with his evil twin leaves Jon marooned on a desolate planet. He has no ship, no radio, and no one knows he's there. Meanwhile the shapeshifter teens are spirited to the court of the Adamant emperor himself. Malraff, his torture master, takes control of the teens and is bent on finding the secret of their ability to transform. She will do anything to find out the truth, and she will revels in their suffering.</p> <p>Somehow Jon must find his way out of his imprisonment and rescue the teens. But will there be anything left for him to save even if he can escape? A galaxy on fire with the destructive conquests of the Adamant empire still stands between Jon and any for chance of success. Without allies, recourses, or any reason for hope, his only path is to release the darkness that he is capable of. But can Jon triumph and and still be worthy of that victory?</p>";
