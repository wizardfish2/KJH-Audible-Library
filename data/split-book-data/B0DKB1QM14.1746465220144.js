It changed Cole, too; he became a Prodigy, a powerful cultivator.</p> <p>And Cole will need those powers, because the post-apocalyptic world gets a little crazy: essence-drinking leeches, hostile cultivators, and psycho raiders looking for food, gas, and whatever else they can scrounge. Not to mention the strange beasts and hazardous environment.</p> <p>With his new powers and a motley but lovely crew at his side, Cole will set out on his journey to carve out his own place.</p>";
