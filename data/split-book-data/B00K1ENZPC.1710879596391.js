window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What do gorgons, basilisks, and frogs with feathers all have in common? They're all considered mythological by modern science, and some people are working very hard to keep them that way. Alexander Price is a member of a cryptozoological lineage that spans generations, and it's his job to act as a buffer between the human and cryptid worlds - not an easy task when you're dealing with women who have snakes in place of hair, little girls who may actually be cobras, and brilliant, beautiful Australian zookeepers. And then there's the matter of the murders... </p> <p>Alex thought he was choosing the easier career when he decided to specialize in non-urban cryptids, leaving the cities to his little sister, Verity. It turns out that he had no idea what he was getting himself into. It's a family affair, and everyone - from his reanimated grandfather to his slightly broken telepathic cousin - is going to get involved before things get any better. </p> <p><i>Half-Off Ragnarok</i> is the third installment of the highly praised InCryptid series.</p>";
