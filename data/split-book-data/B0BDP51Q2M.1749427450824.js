His Transcendent status does little to impress top-ranking guilds who think him hysterical and mad, and does less to stop his enemies, the Roaring Bandits, from trampling through the land.</p> <p>At his wit’s end, there is no choice but to take a giant risk and heed a challenge from a strange Castle-Watcher that will test the limits far beyond his level.</p> <p>The path is plagued with seeds of his past from his home world, where he learns some of his guild-mates may not be who they seem.</p> <p>Though his bonds will be tested, his love for family threatened, Aegis refuses to lose himself. He will stop at nothing until he acquires items legendary enough to stand up to the Roaring Bandits, and prevent the overtaking of Strathmar.</p> <p>Will the might of Aegis’ guild be enough to save their home, or will they perish only to wake up in eternal bondage?</p>";
