Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire. </p> <p>Amber Morgan is a rookie in The Elite, an organization tasked with the elimination of rogue preternatural beings in King City. But she has a secret. She's a witch and only joined The Elite to settle a personal score. </p> <p>Her first case is supposed to be the routine investigation of a rogue vampire, but it soon becomes clear that dark forces are at work, darker than anything the team has dealt with in the past. </p> <p>When an irritatingly sexy Hunter offers to help, Amber wants to say hell no! The last thing she needs is another distraction, even if he is sin personified. But with the fate of a missing child at stake and a possible connection between the case and her past, how can she refuse? </p>";
