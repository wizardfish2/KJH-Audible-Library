The governments declare war to keep the SuperVillains suppressed, but they don't stop there, fearing even those with good souls. Devon is a dentist with some quirks who saves a mother and her daughters, only to have the military betray him.</p> <p>He awakes in the future, confined to Vault 12 with nineteen of his peers. The mysteries confound those around him, but Devon is not an ordinary Super. No, he's special and with Olivia—a lovely Super with a troubled past—at his side, they'll figure out their true purpose. When they do, humanity will never be the same.</p>";
