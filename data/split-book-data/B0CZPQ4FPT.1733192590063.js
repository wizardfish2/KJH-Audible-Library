The walls are manned, and the Valtorian host has come. As we await the final battle, the forces of Tan'Malas spread their corruption through both camps. The war threatens to consume everything we've worked for and take from me all those I care about. I learned the hard way how easy it is to lose everyone and everything. I will not let that happen again. To me, my girls and my friends are more important than all of Greystone and Valtoria combined.</p> <p>Benny and Legs, my trusted War Beasts, risk it all to reach their next evolutions, while Grom finally comes to terms that he has to fight in order to survive. They, along with the power of my beautiful women and new allies, will make sure that we all make it out of the siege alive.</p> <p>The dome trembles under the onslaught of enemy spells, and screams echo across the city as animus, creatures of Tan'Malas, corrupt and devour the living. The time has come to decide. Will we stay and fight to possibly live or leave it all behind and get a new chance most won't?</p> <p>The darkest hour of Greystone's history has come as the first towers and walls crumble, then fall.</p>";
