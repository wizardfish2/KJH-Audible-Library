Kaethlan bands struggle in opposition. Dina has succumbed to her Gift, unable to unite her people.</p> <p>Tristan and his Bound remember their debts. Sacred valleys devoid of life draw the Risen north, but the Kaethlans will not be left to guard their homeland alone.</p> <p><b>What lies beneath the ice?</b></p> <p>A fell miasma guards against intrusion. It blisters the soul and reeks of the Fallen. What is hidden within promises power and threatens oblivion.
