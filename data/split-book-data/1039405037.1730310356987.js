Mace) is a former detective of major crimes who is forced to retire. </b></p> <p>His former captain offers him a job as an in-game constable for the hottest virtual reality game around, <i>Immersion Online</i>. This down-and-out detective knows nothing of character creation, leveling up, or magical artifacts. He is a real noob.</p> <p>He spawns in the Wilderbrook - a group of human and humanoid villages hundreds of miles from the nearest city - to learn the ins and outs of the game before he assumes his role as a constable in Grandview, one of the largest cities in The Great Realm. In the Wilderbrook, he and his new companions come up against an ancient evil. Mace is low-level and way out of his league. But virtual world or not, Mace still has his wits and training as a detective...and he is going to need them!</p>";
