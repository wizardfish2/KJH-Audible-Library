She certainly didn’t mind.</p> <p>Of course, the mayor did, and now I’ve been exiled to some dark, distant forest on the other side of the continent.</p> <p>What do you do when your entire village, and even your own family, betrays you?</p> <p>Start plotting your revenge, of course.</p> <p>After saving a beautiful woman’s life and nearly getting beaten to death for it, I became the proud owner of a castle core, the central power of every village. The core’s spirit levels up like any human, gives their owner access to more powerful classes, and provide buffs to the townsfolk.</p> <p>The best part? Every woman I marry gains a similar boost in power.</p> <p>One day, my wives and I will return to my former home as conquerors.</p> <p>As long as the local king doesn’t kill us first.</p> <p><b><i>Castle Core</i></b><b> is a fantasy LitRPG twist on the typical dungeon core story, featuring harem, slice-of-life, and town-building elements.</b></p>";
