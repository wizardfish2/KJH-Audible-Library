Only one question remains:</b></p> <p><b>WANT TO MAKE SOME KITTENS TONIGHT?</b></p> <p><b>Captain Nathan Kade just wants a quick job</b> to keep his busted-up spaceship limping through the Solar System.</p> <p><b>Instead he gets Vessani S’Kaari, a mysterious and beautiful catgirl</b> who tried—and failed—to steal a ship belonging to a band of space pirates. She’s chaos in a tight catsuit, but she also has a lead on what may be the greatest treasure trove of lost technology the Solar System has ever seen.</p> <p><b>Not to mention a really nice…tail.</b> He pulls that tail out of the fire, and together they assemble a team to seek out this long-lost bounty. <b>Soon, he’s commanding a ragtag crew of space cowboys:</b></p> <ul> <li>A warrior catgirl who’s as deadly with a wink as her blade</li> <li>A snarky multi-bodied robot commando pilot</li> <li>A sexy engineer who knows how to make a reactor purr</li> <li>And a grumpy, cyber-implanted cleric who whispers with the remnants of ancient gods</li> </ul> <p>They’ll dodge spaceship fire, flirt with danger (and each other), and maybe—just maybe—make the score of a lifetime.</p> <p><b>But they’re not the only ones chasing the prize.</b> The Jovian Everlife has dispatched a fleet of warships with one of their elite, many-bodied agents in command, and he’d like a few words with Nathan and his catgirls—preferably in chains.</p> <p><b>Guns will blaze. Spaceships will burn. Tails will swish.</b></p> <p><b>And somewhere in all that mayhem, a broke captain might just find everything he never knew he wanted.</b><br> <br> <i>Embark on the adventure of a lifetime with national best-selling author Jacob Holo and Amazon best-selling author Edie Skye in this brand new science fiction standalone. If you’re a fan of wild futuristic technology, wilder catgirls, and spicy scrappy crew space opera, this just might be the story you’ve been waiting for.</i></p>";
