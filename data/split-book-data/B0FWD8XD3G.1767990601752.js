Infinite worlds to explore.</b></p> <p>Percy was born with little hope of standing out—just another face in a world ruled by bloodlines and class. <b>Starting with the lowest Red core and mocked as a waste,</b> Percy was always overlooked by his peers and scorned by the powerful. But when his <b>bloodline</b> awakens with the power to send clones across worlds, he seizes the chance to shatter expectations.</p> <p>Exploring strange realms teeming with danger, Percy returns with priceless treasures: <b>divine techniques</b>, <b>obscure knowledge</b>, and even the seed of a second mana core stolen from an advanced civilization. But the <b>road to the apex</b> is riddled with peril. The elixirs he needs to advance? He’ll have to master <b>alchemy </b>to brew them himself. The Great Houses, scheming titans, and invading gods?</p> <p><b>They’ll do anything to crush him before he can prove that even a so-called waste can reach the stars.</b></p>";
