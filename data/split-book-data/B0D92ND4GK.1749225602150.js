In the sands of Egypt, Praxion's team seeks to uncover the secrets of Anubis, the Egyptian god of death and the leader of the Kynolari's Lost Tribe. A second team, led by Chirk, ventures into the heart of Mexico, searching for a lost Incan temple of Xolotl, whose association with death and physical description match that of Anubis. Both teams race against time, guided by mysterious legends and plagued by dangers, both ancient and modern.</p> <p>Separated from the others, Micah and Jess embark on a perilous journey south through a transformed America, now a mosaic of Draun-fueled terror, where danger lurks at every stop, and no one can be trusted.</p> <p>As ancient truths unfold into dreadful revelations, the bonds of friendship, love, and loyalty are tested against the backdrop of humanity teetering on the edge of annihilation.
