With both magic and the system that dictates the nature of everything malfunctioning, the world is in jeopardy. Unfortunately for the world, the heroes aren't doing so well either.</p> <p>Following a challenging battle, the foursome is regrouping in a reality not unlike their own, where magic, instead of the system, saved the world. Sev, the team's human priest, is still trying to figure out how his history plays into everything that's been happening. The normally brave half-orc Misa is grappling with failure and fear. Lizardkin wizard Vex is haunted by his past as he works to pave a path to the future. And sentient suit of armor Derivan must navigate both the mysteries of days gone by and his new relationship with Vex. At least they're closer to discovering the root of Elyra's troubles—if only they could get back there.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Elyra, the seeds of resistance are beginning to sprout. Not everyone—even amongst the nobles—is fine with the status quo. But can a rebellion succeed when the kingdom itself is on the verge of falling apart?</p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with almost two million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
