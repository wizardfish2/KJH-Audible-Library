Together with his three wives, they had survived the revelations and grown closer. Now, other problems had come to the fore, demanding to be dealt with.</p> <p>Given a quest by the Overlord, Alburet and his wives had a goal that they could not ignore, because failing it would shatter their family. To even have a chance at success, they would need to reach max level as quickly as they could for the first end-tier raid.</p> <p>The raid would bring Alburet back to where it all began: the Lost Prison of Alctriuz. There, Stein resided, raising an army of cultists and undead to topple Stormguard and the world. A raid event that would involve hundreds of players and thousands of NPCs was brewing.</p> <p>Welcome to the final installment of Alpha World.</p> <p><b>Warning: Contains mature content, including a polyamorous relationship.</b></p>";
