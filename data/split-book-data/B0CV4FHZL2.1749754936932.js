window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The full story! <br> <br> </b><b><i>Book one blurb: </i></b><b><br> Everyone with the gift is going to the academy. Not me. I'll master magic my own way.</b></p> <p>School was a chore. All I wanted was to become a magus, enter the academy, and train my chosen affinity. But I didn't pass the test. They said I didn't have it in me.</p> <p>Years later, a run-in with a sassy goth mage named Misty revealed I could do magic. Those damn monocle-wearing pseudo-Victorians at the academy locked me out! Screw them.</p> <p>I'm now illegally training my chaos affinity while working at Misty's magic/videogame store, and I'm getting lost in her rockin' curves in those fishnet stockings.</p> <p>Things get even more chaotic when a sweet, adorable academy professor walks in. I know I shouldn't date the enemy, but she might know why my magic was hidden.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a gym-bunny mage-cop discovers the scorched spell marks on our secret training fieldâ€¦</p> <p><b>I'm soon left with a choice; continue my fun, chilled-out life at the store, or discover the true extent of my power, and the real reason they feared to enroll me.</b></p>";
