window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Seanan McGuire's <i>New York Times</i> best-selling and Hugo Award-nominated urban fantasy InCryptid series continues with the 12th book following the Price family, cryptozoologists who study and protect the creatures living in secret all around us.</p> <p><i>Reunion</i>, noun:</p> <ol> <li>The state of being united again.</li> </ol> <p><i>Reconciliation</i>, noun:</p> <ol> <li>An act of reconciling, as when former enemies agree to an amiable truce.</li> <li>The process of making consistent or compatible.</li> <li>See also “<i>impossible</i>”.</li> </ol> <p>Alice Price-Healy gave up her life for 50 years to focus completely on the search for her missing husband. The danger of focus like that is that it leaves little room for thinking about what happens after...and now that she’s finally managed to find Thomas, she has no idea what she’s supposed to do next. The fact that he comes with a surrogate daughter who may or may not have some connection to Alice’s recently adopted grandson is just icing on the complicated cake.</p> <p>So the three of them are heading for the most complicated place in the universe: they’re going home.</p> <p>But things on Earth have changed while Alice, Thomas, and Sally have been away. The Covenant of St. George, antagonized by Verity’s declaration of war and Sarah’s temporary relocation of an entire college campus, is trying to retake North America from the cryptids and cryptozoologists who’ve been keeping the peace for the past hundred years. And they’re starting in New York.</p> <p>Alice and company have barely been back for an hour before the Ocean Lady and the Queen of the Routewitches are sending them to New York to help, and they find themselves embroiled in the politics of dragons, kidnappings, and of course, the most dangerous people of all: family.</p> <p>Getting “back to normal” may be the hardest task Alice has undertaken yet.</p>";
