To make matters worse, the other gods may be taking a hand in things now. That would be good if they weren't more worried about ending the status quo than facing the threat to all of Verden.</p> <p>But the war god is not alone in this. His team will bring armies to fight for him, even as he learns what it truly means to be a god. It isn't the end step that many seem to think it is, but rather just another rung on ladder of cultivation.</p> <p>Once those secrets are unlocked he finds out that death may only be the beginning.</p> <p>This book contains detailed adult activities and is intended for mature listeners. </p>";
