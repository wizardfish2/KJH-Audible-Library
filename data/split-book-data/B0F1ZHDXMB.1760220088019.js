But to his friends and the rest of mankind, he's the only hope in the coming apocalypse.</b></p> <p>All Marek wanted was time alone with a good book. Instead, he's given a Class of legend, the spirits speak his name, and the fate of the world rests on his shoulders.</p> <p>His simple life shatters the moment he awakens as the next Remnant Mage. His body, mind, and core begin a relentless transformation. Gifted—or cursed—with the ability to perceive what lurks behind the veil, Marek must learn to command the lingering spirits that haunt its unseen depths.</p> <p>Yet no quest can be completed without a best friend. Nor may a hero rise to great heights without the guidance and snark of an abyssal minion. Fate has determined their path. Now it's up to Marek and Mags to find the allies they lack and the unforeseen boons needed in their quest to save the Twin Realms.</p> <p>May the Principalities bless them. Heavens know they'll need it.</p> <p><i>Blending epic fantasy and LitRPG, </i>Remnant Mage <i>is perfect for fans of He Who Fights with Monsters, Cradle, and The Beginning After the End.
