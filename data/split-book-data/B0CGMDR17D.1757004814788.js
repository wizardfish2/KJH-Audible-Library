Join our reluctant hero and his growing band of ragtag friends as they fight for the very future of mankind in book two of the Infinity Construct series.</p> <p>After The Corruptor tracks him back to Darkwood Village, Sabashton soon finds himself forced to hold off an entire army by himself while his friends help the terrified villagers flee. With nowhere to turn, they head for the only place left for them to runâ€”his soon-to-be over-crowded magical glade. </p> <p>Memphis and Sy join with Grom, Tash, and Lady V as they follow Ash into the untamed wilds of Infinity to locate V's secret gateway to hell, hidden deep inside the orcish wastelands of the north. Far beyond the enchantment of the Empire's protected roads they find new potential allies among the woodland fae of Queen Tressaria and her fairy kingdom. To earn the Queen's trust, Sabashton must risk his scan being trapped in an eternity of suffering by attempting the deadly Trial of Immortals.</p> <p>Join our heroes as they venture into the unknown heartlands of infinity. They find a world filled with everything from baby giants to tiny fae and all manner of strange and magical curiosities. With the future of Infinity and the soul of humanity on the line, Ash will do everything he can to become strong enough to reach the key buried within the deepest bowels of hell. The only problem is, the more powerful he becomes, the more power he's starting to crave.</p> <p>Warning: parental guidance suggested.
