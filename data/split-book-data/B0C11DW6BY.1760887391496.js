These scientists were trying to break me, recondition me, control me. I had no idea that my life would succumb to this, a mysterious phenomenon in need of experimentation. Because humans feared what they couldn’t understand, and I happened to be a powerhouse in my own right, a supernatural prodigy. But one day, after almost twenty years, I escaped, leaving nothing behind but ashes and acid rain.</p> <p>Little did I know, I’d be reminded of that fateful night I’d left my constant nightmare…</p> <p>Bio nukes fell from the sky with one goal in mind: to essentially turn everyone into superhumans like me.</p> <p>Turning innocent lives into a round of Russian roulette was the name of the game. The aftermath left two sides of the same coin: to become supervillains or superheroes. I choose the latter, but not by choice.</p> <p>Either way, I had a binding contract with The Brother’s Code, a crime-fighting organization where plain supes could train to become TBC Super Heroes.</p> <p>Now I have to make things right, working with The Brother’s Code to stop this wave of supervillains created by the same facility that turned my cells into biological warfare. A team of three girls and I would become superheroes, defying all odds to shut down Sigma-RE for good, just as long as we could find a way to work together.</p> <p>Easier said than done.</p>";
