But which one is she? A System error means she's been split between both, crossing the line between the soulless zombies created by the System and the people brought here by the mysterious Architect.</p> <p>With no proper class, Sally will need to use her smarts and guts (not literally) to level up and best an onslaught of Player Parties who see her as nothing more than experience to gain and bounty to plunder (literally). She'll have to go up against the adventurers tethering the System in place, all the while being chased by a spurned Cleric out for revenge.</p> <p>But Sally won't be turning over and showing her belly. With her own Party—glitched skull Humphrey and rebellious Theo—she's ready to smash the System to pieces until she can demand answers from the Architect themselves. And just maybe she'll find a way to bring the Monsters and Players together while she's at it....</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than 650, 000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
