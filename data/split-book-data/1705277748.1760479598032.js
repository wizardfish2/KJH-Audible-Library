His business ventures in the game are performing admirably, and the testing he's been doing has recently been going quite well.</p> <p>With other settlements to create, a forest elf town to find, a settlement quest still to finish, and the king's quest beyond that, Eddie's staying busy. Unfortunately the NPCs in the game are far too much like real people, so treachery and backstabbing are also within their grasp.</p>";
