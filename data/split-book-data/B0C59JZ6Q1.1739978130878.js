window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Dead or Alive?</b><br> <br> Not a hard question, and pretty easy to figure out either way. Usually.<br> <br> Except I've somehow woken up in a place called Hell, and I'm not entirely sure I died first. I thought it was a practical joke. Until a warrior woman tried to kill me, and I rescued an elf and a succubus from slavers.<br> <br> Turns out, this Hell is being terrorized by an evil king, and heâ€™s hell-bent on bringing all of Hell under his dominion. He also happens to control the portal back to our world, which I very much want to use.<br> <br> So here I am, preparing for battle against an army of ten thousand wraiths, Hellhounds, and sorcerers. If we win, Hell might be changed forever. But the chances of that are achingly slim.<br> <br> <i>This omnibus contains all four books of the complete Wraith King series.</i></p>";
