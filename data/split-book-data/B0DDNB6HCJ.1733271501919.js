window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My powers are only growing. Unfortunately, so are my enemies . . .</p> <p>Flushed with victory after our first Elite Eight round, my team of beautiful women and I are the talk of the System. Now that my warlord powers are coming into their own, we seem to be unstoppable. There’s even talks about expanding our team, and the addition of a curvy goth girl makes things *very* interesting.</p> <p>But it won’t be long until trouble finds us. When an offer comes in for private ownership on behalf of a powerful Blobber, it looks too good to be true. Especially when his beautiful daughter seems to contradict everything he says. We find out quickly that not everything is as it seems at the top of Blobber society, and it’s going to put us into a fight to the death with a foe we never saw coming.</p> <p>The rulers of the System are trying to keep us under control, but a warlord makes his own destiny. Nothing, not even the System, is going to stand in my way.</p>";
