Once every generation, someone in his family is called upon to be a Chosen One, and Axel’s prepared himself extensively, just in case it’s him.</p> <p>He just wasn't prepared for the portal.</p> <p>Now he's in another world brimming with dangerous monsters beneath a sky full of magic portals ... and with no idea what he's been summoned to do. All he knows is that every Chosen Radcliff has been aided by a support staff of skilled women.</p> <p>When mysterious monster girls start wreaking havoc in this new world, Axel is ready to answer the call. He’ll have to draw upon insight borne from every tabletop RPG he’s played and every LitRPG novel he’s read to face them, because these are either the women he’s destined to gather … or the force he’s been summoned to stop.</p> <p>Either way, these monster girls need to be tamed!</p>";
