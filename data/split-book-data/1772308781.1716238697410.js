The closing jaws of a trap years in the making. </b></p> <p>It has been over a year since the UnArcana Worlds of the Protectorate of the Mage-King of Mars seceded, shattering the unity of the human race. The new Republic of Faith and Reason has raised new banners in defiance of the power of the Protectorate's Mage aristocracy. </p> <p>Now, Hand Damien Montgomery commands a relief mission to a Republic world ravaged by famine.

They are coming for the Protectorate - and they will see the fleets of Mars break!</p>";
