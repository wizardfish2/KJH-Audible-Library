Moving to a new city for college is supposed to be a fresh start, but it never feels right.</p> <p>Just as things begin to settle, Damian comes home to find a demonic goatman waiting to kill him. Luckily, a badass angel with a sword saves him—except she isn’t an angel, and Damian isn’t as human as he thought.</p> <p>Now, with his mother missing, Damian is caught in the middle of a war between worlds.
