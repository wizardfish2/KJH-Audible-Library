window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The complete series for a single offering!</p> <p>Garrett Cross is no stranger to traveling the outlands. He's been roaming for years, hunting down vampires and giving them exactly what they deserve: sharpened stakes and silver bullets.</p> <p>Now, he's come to Frontier Falls. It's a little settlement where humans and vampires have made peace. But if there's one thing Cross knows, it's vampires, and any deal they make is one just waiting to be broken.</p> <p>It's not long before Cross finds himself fond of the town's locals—chief among them a sheriff's daughter and a tinkerer's daughter. Love after so much time spent with only his pistols for company is a little strange, but it's not exactly unexpected. He's known love before—after all, that's what put him on the road way back when.</p> <p>But the last thing he expected when coming to Frontier Falls was to become its new sheriff. Or that doing so would have the local witch name him the prophesied Arcane Lawmaker.</p> <p>Whatever Frontier Falls and its denizens have in store for Garrett Cross, it's clear he's not going to be leaving anytime soon.</p>";
