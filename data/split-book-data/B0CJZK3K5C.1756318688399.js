window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A romping fast-paced fantasy adventure with a ridiculously overpowered main character in the trope of <i>Shrek</i> and <i>One Punch Man</i>.</p> <p>Book One of a completed duology. </p> <p>A monster dungeon is all Thomas has ever known. After all, he was born there. Now, at age 14, he’s been solo-clearing all 100 floors of the dungeon for years. The last of his family and friends are about to die off as an eternal void beast tirelessly pursues them. Will they ever escape? </p> <p>Thomas’ strength is unparalleled, but what does it matter when you’re trapped in an endlessly repeating prison? He would love nothing more than to see the sky for the very first time and find a safe place to settle down. Fate has much more in mind, but her best efforts only go so far when it comes to the overpowered dungeon boy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nell Windborn lives in a tiny village, clustered on the side of the hundred-league-tall cliff. When the villagers run out of water, they attempt a daring plan, only for their best-laid plans to go awry. Nell can’t save them alone, but maybe she won’t have to, as strange new visitors drop from the sky.</p>";
