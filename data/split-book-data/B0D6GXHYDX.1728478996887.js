With the power of the Soul Knight class, he would have to use both paladin and necromancer magics to conquer the tower and defeat his enemies.</p> <p>But not all was right, in or outside the tower. A bandit warlord had taken control of the city of Havendale, and a deathly Trial within the tower lurks, barring Nick from collecting his Heritage.</p> <p>Will Nick take his first step toward Eternity and claim his kingdom, or will he fall before his journey begins?</p> <p><b>Contains: LitRPG/Cultivation System, Tower Climbing, Kingdom Building, and loveable beastfolk girls with dating and romance.</b></p>";
