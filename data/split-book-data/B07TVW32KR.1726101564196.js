window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Meeting a dark Elf was unexpected. Kuro offered unconditional servitude in exchange for being saved, and Gothy was determined to make the most of it.</p> <p>Kuro had a single request: to warn the Queen that the King had broken their pact. Alvin agreed to take her to her world to report, wondering if it would be as easy as it sounded. Meanwhile, Kuro held up her end of the bargain, doing everything Gothy asked of her.</p> <p>Driving through the Svargax Gate, what they saw before them was not what any of them expected: two armies at war with each other, one composed of the dark Queen’s Elves, the other of the light King’s Elves.</p> <p>Feeling his simple plan go out the window, Alvin decided to find out if the King’s Elves could be reasoned with. Realizing it would be more difficult than he thought, Alvin wondered if he could reach some sort of accord with either side.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer: </b>This book contains adult situations, in all their horror and glory, including but not limited to: sex, abuse, drug use, and murder.
