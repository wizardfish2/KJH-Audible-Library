But once this is over, he’ll be free to relax and spend some quality time with his Champions.</p> <p>As the war heats up, Nathan finds himself caught up in the schemes and fluffy tails of one of his former Champions, Narime. More figures from his past intrude, including a dark elf with a twisted personality and a princess who makes Nathan question his memories.</p> <p>Behind everything, Kadria lurks alongside the other Messengers. Nathan finds himself buried in politics and at risk of losing everything, should his heretical alliance with her be discovered. In the end, the risk is worth it. Because the reward is to get back everything that he lost.</p> <p><i>Heretic Spellblade 2 </i>contains plenty of violence, harem/undefined relationships, beast girls, and scenes that don’t fade to black. Consider yourself warned.</p>";
