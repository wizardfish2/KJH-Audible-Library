Join Tim, Dave, Julian, and Cooper as they are thrown into a hostile fantasy world filled with magic and monsters, and ruled over by a cruel and sadistic game master who taunts and harasses them while he sits back and eats their fried chicken.</p> <p>Having taken on the bodies of their fantasy characters, Tim and the others are forced to discover the answers to two questions that every underachieving lowlife who's ever rolled a d20 has asked themselves at least once.</p> <p>What if you and your friends got to live the game for real? What if you and your friends were assholes?</p> <p>Would you have what it takes to survive? The strength? The wisdom? The...charisma?</p> <p>Do you have the dice in your sack?</p> <p>It's like <i>Lord of the Rings</i> meets your mom in a truck stop bathroom, but even cheaper.</p> <p>This set includes:</p> <ol> <li><i>Critical Failures</i></li> <li><i>Critical Failures II: Fail Harder</i></li> <li><i>Critical Failures III: A Storm of S-Words</i></li> <li><i>Critical Failures IV: The Phantom Pinas</i></li> </ol>";
