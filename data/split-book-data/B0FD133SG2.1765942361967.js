But while she has the ability to assess others' primary loyalties, she remains deeply uncertain as to whom she can trust. Indeed, she even doubts her own mother's intentions. Fortunately, as she surveys her surroundings and navigates court intrigue, she's guided by a voice in her head: that of Kelsey, a sentient dungeon with an ax to grind.</p> <p>Unable to stifle her snarky attitude, Kelsey's avatar offends the black-eyed god Riadi when she expresses her desire to free the mortal races—a mission she expects Suliel to play a significant role in. Meanwhile, Suliel's husband, Anton, sails the sea without a map . . . but with plenty of direction from Kelsey. As he and his crew dodge flaming arrows, they ready their superior weapons to claim victory over an Elitran ship and free the slaves aboard.</p> <p>It's all part of Kelsey's elaborate—and possibly reckless—plan to bring unprecedented firepower to the ongoing battle between the oppressed and the oppressor. And now, backed by some unexpected allies, a few helpful skeletons, and new, untested weapons mightier than the sword, their quest continues. One thing's for sure: where Kelsey goes, trouble usually follows . . .</p> <p><b>From the author of Phantasm: The third volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—originally released on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
