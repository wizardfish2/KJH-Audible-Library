But after an up-close-and-personal meeting with a runaway semitruck—and subsequent dealings with a rather flustered Angel of Prodigals—he found himself in a new world, reincarnated as a run-down old house that just barely qualified as a dungeon. However, it didn't take long for him to build his core, mana, and reputation, making friends along the way.</p> <p>Nowadays, having vanquished the truly vicious dungeon Neverrest, Thedeim is finally getting comfortable. His array of minions—animal, insect, etc.—are well in hand and operating at full efficiency, while he enjoys managing daring delvers and awkward adventurers as needed. He's also working to spread his (mostly) beneficent influence across the land. But it hasn't been easy, what with guiding his own irascible scions, wrangling rogue dungeons, countering truly evil entities, providing for those he cares for, and basically keeping things as non-nightmarish as possible for everyone.</p> <p>In short, he's a very busy dungeon. And he's about to get busier. Because there are those who don't appreciate Thedeim's efforts. And he's about to discover that when you can't make everybody happy, somebody is bound to become very, very <i>un</i>happy . . .</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than seven million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
