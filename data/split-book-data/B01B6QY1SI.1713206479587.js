window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We repelled the Swarm - for now. But they won't stop: They're inhuman. They have no inhibitions. No conscience. And no mercy. But from the crucible of battle has risen an unlikely hero. Captain Timothy Granger, at the helm of another time-tested battleship, will take the fight to the enemy. He'll discover their secrets. Find their homeworld. Destroy it before they destroy ours. He will save us all. He must. Or we'll die. </p>";
