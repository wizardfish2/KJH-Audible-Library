window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The thrilling opening installment of a xianxia series that takes the least qualified human and puts him in the most impossible—but hilarious—of positions.</b></p> <p>Before meeting his pathetic and all-too-predictable demise in the middle of a pie-eating contest, Zack was living the high life: schlubbing around his parents' basement, subsisting on pizza, video games, computer screens, and web novels. He had it all . . . while still being a big, fat nothing.</p> <p>But when he's forced to ditch his pudgy mortal corpse, Zack finds himself taking the place of a recently-killed demonic sect elder known as Slifer, who—even as an elderly man—is one serious badass. He's known and feared by all as a master, with a slew of disciples at his beck and call. Not a bad upgrade from the uber-nerd Zack used to be.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are some snags. First, Slifer wasn't exactly a people person and has a slew of enemies out to remove his head from his body. Second, the overlord System he's operating under is out to eliminate all demonic cultivators—himself included. And third, well, let's wait and see if he survives the first two before we get to <i>that</i> mess . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than a million views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
