That was the bad news. The good? We had time to prepare. I have my own party now, made up of a feisty earth girl, a naïve but lovable moon elf, and a larger-than-life giantess. Who also happens to be a princess. We need to find a fifth member to round out the party before it is too late.</p> <p><i>What do we do?</i></p> <p>Cultivate strength. Form alliances. And hope we’ve got what it takes to save Sklava City.</p>";
