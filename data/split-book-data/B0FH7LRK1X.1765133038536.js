She’s kind, caring, drop dead gorgeous and with her best friend, and my second wife, Alfofida, the beautiful, intelligent inventor. Well, they make one hell of a pair.</p> <p>The politics of this world be damned. I’ve got things settling in pretty well right now. Except after delivering the badly wounded Kiggaelin to her father. I was sent back with Elder Obsidian to seal the tunnel and cement my permanence on this world.

A last ditch effort to hold me accountable for his perceived wrongs.</p> <p>I can only hope that when the dust settles, we can live with the consequences.</p>";
