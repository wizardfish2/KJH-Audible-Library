window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of Ultimate Level 1: When a bold teenager discovers a strange egg, he becomes the first human in generations to bond with a dragon.</b></p> <p>Kaen is a typical teenage orphan in Ebonmount—toiling in a quarry for his keep as he yearns for adventure far beyond the confines of his laborious existence. But everything changes when he stumbles upon a bronze egg. From its shell emerges Pammon, a dragon, marking Kaen as the first human in generations to bond with such a creature and entwining his destiny with that of the elite adventurers’ guild. Suddenly thrust into a life he’s only dreamed of, Kaen embraces his bond with Pammon and what it truly means to be chosen by fate.</p> <p>But as he steps onto the path once walked by his late father, the thrill of adventure is overshadowed by his quest for the truth behind the man’s mysterious death. Soon Kaen and Pammon’s journey becomes one fraught with peril, filled with both the promise of discovery and the ever-present risk of loss. Together, they must navigate their bond, the guild’s expectations, and the reality that every flight soars on the wings of danger.</p> <p>Serving up breathtaking exploits as well as the true heart of a family drama, <i>Dawn of the Last Dragon Rider </i>is perfect for fans of Christopher Paolini and Rick Riordan alike.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with almost two million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
