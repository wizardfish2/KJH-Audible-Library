Then, without any warning, he found himself part of an experiment with not even so much as the courtesy of a \"<i>how do you do?</i>\".</p> <p>It wasn't really all bad, though. The fit, busty babes outnumbered him 30 to one. Now, Jay has to fight to survive. He has to conquer the dungeon or die. On top of that, he has to juggle a bunch of gorgeous women who are all stuck in the same life or death fight as him.
