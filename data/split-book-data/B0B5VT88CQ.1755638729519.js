Now she’s got an all-new weirdness on her radar. The Twelve Days of Crisismas are coming, and without a special brew of eggnog, Taffy and the Ex-Mas Posse will transform into horrific Grumpus monsters, annihilating Dolli’s dungeon from the inside out.</p> <p>That special brew—Egg Noggin-Fogger—is just what the neckbeards ordered. The guild of heroes raids Monster Haven relentlessly to get their hands on the whiskey blend, pushing back the Posse’s production and putting the whole brew at risk. If they can’t get a few days of peace and quiet, they’ll have no choice but to flee Monster Haven to prepare for the horrific transformation.</p> <p>Dolli must take her dungeon on the road to avoid the raids, all while searching for her own game ender: Sherkahn’s Shillelagh, a tool of the heroes’ own making that has the power to close the portals to her world once and for all. Can they evade the neckbeards long enough to complete the brew, or will Dolli have to send her merry elf additions into the wilds to protect her dungeon and finish the quest for the staff? </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
