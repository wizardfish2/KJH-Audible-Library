window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A laugh-out-loud, slice-of-life martial-arts fantasy about...farming????</b></p> <p>Jin Rou wanted to be a cultivator. A man powerful enough to defy the heavens. A master of martial arts. A lord of spiritual power. Unfortunately for him, he died, and now I’m stuck in his body.</p> <p>Arrogant Masters? Heavenly Tribulations? All that violence and bloodshed? Yeah, no thanks. I’m getting out of here.</p> <p>Farm life sounds pretty great. Tilling a field by hand is fun when you’ve got the strength of ten men—though maybe I shouldn’t have fed those Spirit Herbs to my pet rooster. I’m not used to seeing a chicken move with such grace...but Qi makes everything kind of wonky, so it’s probably fine.</p> <p>Instead of a lifetime of battle, my biggest concerns are building a house, the size of my harvest, and the way the girl from the nearby village glares at me when I tease her.</p> <p>A slow, simple, fulfilling life in a place where nothing exciting or out of the ordinary ever happens...right?</p> <p>The first volume of the blockbuster progression-fantasy series—with more than 16 million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</p>";
