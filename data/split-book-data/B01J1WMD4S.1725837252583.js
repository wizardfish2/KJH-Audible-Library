In the darkness, they fought to survive. Now the fleet decays, and their hope of finding a better world is fading. </p><p>Era Corinth works to preserve the archives, but viewing them herself would be treason. When she's faced with the possibility that her unborn child may be aborted due to a genetic defect, her fascination with ancient secrets escalates to obsession. </p><p>Brutal conspiracies and devastating betrayals threaten to fracture the fleet. And the colonists have forgotten the most important lesson their ancestors swore to remember: It took only one wrong choice to destroy life on Earth. </p><p>Will their descendants make the same mistake? </p>";
