It was the fault of those who wanted to get in his way of making as much money as possible as a smuggler.</p> <p>His family had been gifted with a letter of marque for the Terran Confed, one that is inherited and has been passed down to him. Essentially, it gives him a lot of loopholes and ways through regulations to be a fantastic smuggler. Or as a legal pirate, a Privateer.</p> <p>The Confed and its neighbors are about to be plunged into a world of war that spans across the entirety of their universe. From the citizens of the Blood to the Scrap-Worlds on the outer edges of the Confed, the life of everyone is going to change.</p> <p>And Ralph?</p> <p>Well, Ralph is about to get a brand new letter of marque to add to his original one, except for the territories of the Blood of Calesat.</p> <p>Ralph Turlan will go from smuggler to Privateer with a commission to burn the enemy to their deck plates all while getting a bonus for every ship he puts out of the war. It's time to go collect Turlan's Toll from anyone who crosses his path.</p> <p>Let's just hope the crew of cast-offs better fit for the isle of misfit toys can come together quickly.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
