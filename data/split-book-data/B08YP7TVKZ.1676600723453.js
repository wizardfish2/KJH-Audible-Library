window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Join scholar and spell-caster Everson Croft in this five-book urban fantasy set, from the discovery of his magic in the prequel novella, Book of Souls, to his battle against a mind-warping evil in the shocking finale, </b><b><i>Death Mage</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Who is Professor Croft?&nbsp;</p> <p>If he sat beside you on the subway, you might notice his disheveled coat and burnt satchel, but you’d have no idea he was New York’s hardest-working mage (or that his cat talked). Never properly trained, he's been learning on the job. Outwitting vampires, wrestling werewolves, banishing powerful demons - all while holding down a teaching gig. But wizarding is in his blood, and he’ll do whatever it takes to protect his dysfunctional city, even if he mashes a few toes along the way. Watch your feet.&nbsp;</p> <p>This value set features the first four novels and the prequel novella in the spell-crackling Prof Croft series: <i>Book of Souls</i>, <i>Demon Moon</i>, <i>Blood Deal</i>,<i> Purge City</i>, and <i>Death Mage</i>. Your ticket to magic and mayhem awaits!</p>";
