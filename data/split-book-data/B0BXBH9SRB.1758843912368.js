The cops have no leads. Other PIs haven't fared any better. The trail is colder than an arctic winter. And to make matters worse, a mysterious creature from Javy Diaz's past has taken an alarming interest in the case.</p> <p>But all that might be the least of my problems. Because you know everything you've heard about the pitfalls of social media?</p> <p>Yeah. Turns out it's worse than that.</p> <p>Way worse.</p> <p>And having 113 million crazed fans breathing down my neck as I search for their lost idol might prove more dangerous than crossing paths with whoever actually took her in the first place . . .</p>";
