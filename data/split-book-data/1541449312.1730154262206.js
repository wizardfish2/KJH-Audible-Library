window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Astra has become one of the most popular Sentinels in Chicago, past scandals notwithstanding, and is now the team leader of the Young Sentinels. But on their first big solo outing, the new junior Sentinels fall into a new scandal - one which could cost them the team. And Astra has a dream visit from Kitsune, the odd shapeshifter-thief who precipitated the battle between the Sentinels and Villains Inc. the year before. The dream warns of a fresh disaster, in a town Astra has never seen before and that may not actually exist.</p> <p>Astra's efforts to find the town from her dream leads to her \"recruitment\" by the shadowy Department of Superhuman Affairs, and she leaves the team behind in Chicago to learn more about the DSA's secrets than are good for her, face old enemies, and discover a little town called Littleton. Fortunately for Astra, \"leaving the team\" does not mean she's on her own.</p>";
