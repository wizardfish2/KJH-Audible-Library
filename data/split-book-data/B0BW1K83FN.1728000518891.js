Even his dragon companion had made new friends and found a fulfilling life. And with Leila's first child on the way, Charlie really thought the universe was smiling on him at long last.</p> <p>He should have known better.</p> <p>It seemed his old friend Mr. Murphy had caught wind of his complacency and had other plans for him, paying an unexpected visit and abruptly throwing them all into a mess beyond their wildest dreams, turning poor Charlie's world upside down in an instant.</p> <p>With more than just his own galaxy at stake Charlie and his friends now faced a new enemy power the likes of which they'd never imagined in a intergalactic war spanning the stars.
