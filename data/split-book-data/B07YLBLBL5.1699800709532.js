window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>(Minor spoiler and warning at the bottom of the blurb. Please read all the way through.)&nbsp;</p> <p>Sameerixis, or Sam for those who actually know him, isn’t what you’d call normal.&nbsp;</p> <p>He’s a door-to-door salesman, of sorts. One that peddles wares, wishes, and whims to anyone willing to pay his prices.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prices that usually involve a few years of your life, maybe a handful of days, or a single night of pleasure that’ll cost a few hours.&nbsp;</p> <p>He’s an incubus that solves problems. Mental, emotional, spiritual, material, and anything and everything in between. Sam can provide an answer and resolution.&nbsp;</p> <p>A one-man shop and service provider.&nbsp;</p> <p>Or he was. When he had work available to him.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately, he’s been unable to work for quite a while, due to the simple fact that he’s been imprisoned against his will by an old business partner.&nbsp;</p> <p>Except something’s changed.&nbsp;</p> <p>A portal, a way back to the planes, has opened with his name on it. On the other side isn’t what he wished for nor what he feared.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sam’s made the choice to go back and start up his business again. From the ground up. In just a moment he’ll make that leap over and into another plane.&nbsp;</p> <p>Little does he know that with that first step he’ll move straight from the known, to the unknown, then to the inadvisable.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Warning:</b> This novel explores dark subjects, and what people will give up of themselves, and each other, to get what they want. The main character is written as a demon from another plane in a tough situation, and will not make choices that line up with societal and cultural norms.&nbsp;</p> <p>It contains adult themes and moral ambiguities.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>As with my previous work, explicit scenes are found within. It has violence and a harem relationship.</i></p>";
