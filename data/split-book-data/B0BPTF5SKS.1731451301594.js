A winner is he! </p> <p>Artorian wakes in youthful form version three, and happier he could not be. Exploring Avalon is a treat to the senses, with cat cafes galore and gossip flowing evermore. Lectures on Laws and leisurely walks fill his days, with plenty abound to catch the eye. All is well on this enthusiastic stroll until a Heavenly falls from the sky, and Artorian can kiss his simple days good-bye.</p> <p>Escaping to Eternia by shoving a healer into a bag, Artorian has to contend with the mess he left behind. The place may be The Pale, but it’s janitor time! Eternium is ready for spring cleaning, but what’s that strange scent in the air? It’s foul, thick, and cheesy with flair. The penguins are here. All will despair.</p> <p>Artorian prepares his most luminous means. For some stains, more Dakka is needed for cleans.</p>";
