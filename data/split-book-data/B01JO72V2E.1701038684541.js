window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>2288 A.D.</i> is the second book of the number-one best-selling The Ashlyn Chronicles series. The first novel, <i>2287 A.D.</i>, is a Kindle all-star (top 100 Amazon book) that has sold over 100,000 copies in its first year. </p> <p>While <i>2288 A.D.</i> can be listened to as a stand alone novel (and it has no cliffhanger ), we strongly, repeat strongly, recommend you first read or listen to Book 1, <i>2287 A.D.</i> It is where the characters are first introduced, and there is much to be learned about the far reaching arc of the story line and why they make the choices they do. </p> <p>And now, the fun stuff (synopsis): </p> <p>The first novel, <i>2287 A.D.</i>, tells the story of Ashlyn Parker and Steven Sherrah, the man who is in command of Earth's last surviving starship. He has been struggling to keep the handful of Earth's survivors alive, hiding from the most vicious and powerful enemy humanity has ever known, an enemy that is relentless in its determination to see that every last human is killed. </p> <p>Without wanting to give away spoilers, <i>2288 A.D.</i> starts where the first novel ends. It will take them back in time almost 7,000 years. This is where the secret that Ashlyn holds is revealed. It will lead them on an incredible journey of time travel through strange new worlds, changing the history of the universe. </p> <p>Like <i>2287 A.D.</i>, <i>2288 A.D.</i> is packed full of action and adventure. Personally, we hate a three-page description of how a star-drive engine operates. We hope that you too will enjoy a story that moves quickly. </p>";
