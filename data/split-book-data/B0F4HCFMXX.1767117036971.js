He’s a Feral Mage, someone who gains the abilities of monsters by devouring them. This magic has allowed him to excel as a mercenary, rising to the top rank of the guildhall.</p> <p>Bryce finds more than he bargained for while taking what should have been a simple job. Accompanied by a feral wolfkin and a wannabe monster hunter kitsune, he tries to escort a young snow elf woman to the Red Pine Kingdom. Between monsters, criminals, and a pissed-off swordswoman, danger is an inevitability. The further Bryce gets into this job, the more dangerous it becomes. With the deck stacking against them, there’s only one ace up their sleeves.</p> <p>BRYCE IS A BIT OF A MONSTER...OR SEVERAL.</p>";
