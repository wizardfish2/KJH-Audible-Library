In what should have been an open-and-shut murder case, questions begin to pile up fast: who, exactly, was this Jotun Naval captain? Why was there a black ops ship lurking nearby, ready to shoot down anyone who tried to approach?</p> <p>Barnabas has made a promise to a friend that he'll unravel the murder, but the closer he gets, the more he finds himself asking just who this captain was.</p> <p><b>And just what in hell did he get himself involved with.</b></p> <p>NOTE: This book contains cursing. Perhaps humorous cursing, but cursing nevertheless. If this offends you, I don't suggest reading this book.</p>";
