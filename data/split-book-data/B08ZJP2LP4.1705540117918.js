But don’t worry...I’ve got this. Piece of cake.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you like Tim Drake as Robin or ever wondered what Peter Parker would be like if he lived in Gotham, Rap-tors is right up your alley.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>From number one Audible best seller Jaime Castle and CJ Valin comes a new superhero universe perfect for fans of both DC and Marvel. </b></p> <p>Actually, it’s for fans of anything superhero-related.
