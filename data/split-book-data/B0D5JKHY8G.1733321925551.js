window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The end of the world was just the beginning.</b></p> <p>Trouble is coming for Earth and for the people of Crownhill. The wolfmen were only the start. Trolls and ogres now roam these unfamiliar lands. And worst of all, other humans wait and plot against us. With no one else to lead them, the burden of protecting these people falls to me.</p> <p>But I am not alone. Bridget and Sakura loyally stand by my side. And now, at last, I am finally reunited with Myrina, my oldest friend. She hails from the world of the Amazonians, and her people have lived with the System for countless years. They know the answers to questions we haven't even thought to ask.</p> <p>With her help, we just might be able to survive the apocalypse. But she's got problems of her own. Her clan is at war and cannot give me their support. They lack the magic equipment to defeat their rebellious foes. Perhaps a newly minted Artificer might be of use to them.</p> <p><b>Nothing is certain, and conflict runs deeper than I ever realized in this world after the Apocalypse.</b></p>";
