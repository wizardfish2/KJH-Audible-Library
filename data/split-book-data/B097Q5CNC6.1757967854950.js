My witch girlfriend has been marked for death by a vampire temptress who wants me for herself. With both sides spoiling for a fight, the chances of them talking out their problems over lunch are slim.<br> <br> While I’d love to help smooth things over, I’ve been way too distracted dealing with evil leprechauns and redneck werewolves. Worse, something massive has recently been spotted prowling the waters of the Hudson – a titanic creature of <i>biblical</i> proportions that’s about to surface and go all kaiju on our asses.<br> <br> With a tidal wave of chaos closing in, I'll need to choose between my friends, my feelings, and the fate of the world. Sadly, there's little hope of saving everyone I hold dear from the carnage that's about to punch all of humanity square in the moby dick.<br> <br> ----------<br> <br> Join Bill Ryder in this hysterical vampire comedy that blends humor, horror, and stakes to the heart.
