window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains books one, two, and three of Sins of the Father, a humorous supernatural suspense story filled with magic, mythology, and mayhem from Nazri Noor, author of the best-selling Darkling Mage series.</b></p> <p><i>Fallen Reign</i>, book one</p> <p>Mason Albrecht’s life changed the day the angels tried to kill him. As the son of a fallen angel king, Mason is an abomination, one who can command the Vestments, divine arms and armor summoned from heaven’s own arsenals. And everybody wants a piece: death witches, demon princes, even deities of ancient myth.</p> <p>Then, an enterprising enchantress offers to cloak Mason from those who would corrupt him into a living weapon. But will Mason run from supernatural entities forever or embrace his unholy birthright and defy the very forces of heaven and hell?</p> <p><i>False Gods</i>, book two</p> <p>Mason may have found himself a home in a verdant forest dimension, but danger follows the son of Samyaza wherever he goes. There’s trouble brewing in paradise - literally - and when a familiar, flame-toting magus reappears, it’s with catastrophically explosive consequences.</p> <p><i>Morning Star</i>, book three</p> <p>Elements both infernal and celestial keep hampering Mason’s working holiday. And the son of Samyaza has also piqued the interest of another vastly powerful entity...an archangel with a missing sword and an axe to grind.</p> <p>Includes <i>Ex Nihilo</i>, a bonus prequel novella from the Sins of the Father series.</p>";
