That’s a whole new battlefield.</b></p> <p>For seven years, I fought monsters and nightmares across the continent as one of the kingdom’s last war wizards, forged in fire and blood. I’ve buried comrades, burned enemies to ash, and become something feared by both man and beast.</p> <p>Now at last, I’m going home. Back to my family. Back to a promise I swore I’d keep.</p> <p>But the town I left behind didn’t survive the war unscathed. A dark shadow has fallen over it, threatening to destroy anyone that stands in its way.</p> <p>With a vagabond elven princess and a beautiful barmaid at my side, I’ll have to reclaim my home—and rebuild everything they tried to take from me.</p> <p>Even if that means going to war one more time.</p>";
