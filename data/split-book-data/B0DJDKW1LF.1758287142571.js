After giving up his evil Rare Class in exchange for the simple and common Glasser, he’s finally been accepted by the people of Hammon’s Bog. But acceptance doesn't guarantee safety. Mirrors and glass spearheads offer little protection against threats both outside and within.</p> <p>An army of undead is lurking in the surrounding forest, cutting them off from the rest of the world. There’s no rescue in sight, and worse, no one knows why the army is there or when it will attack. Brin's only lead? A chilling revelation: the army's movements are controlled by someone inside the town. As tension rises and time runs out, Brin must unmask the traitorous Witch hidden in plain sight before the town is engulfed in darkness.</p>";
