And now, those people are dangling above his head.</p> <p>A mouse woman, a bat woman, and three anthropomorphic camel people, these five Demons bring with them incredible new glimpses into the state of the world for those lost on the island, namely Riven, Lucerein, and Enkriah.</p> <p>The new information is all well and good, but it doesn't change Riven's goals. He's still being slowly poisoned by the island, and his camp could still use some improvements. No amount of world-shaking revelations will alter that.</p> <p>The new visitors are a welcome change-of-pace, for sure, but it doesn't change the everyday life of Riven the Monster Rancher...</p> <p>Except Enkriah is intent on making it known that Riven is King of the Monsters, and with that comes friction.</p> <p>A former foot soldier, a former demon lord, an undead elf, a sacred priestess, and her loyal guardians... Surely, they can all get along under the banner of the newly declared King.</p>";
