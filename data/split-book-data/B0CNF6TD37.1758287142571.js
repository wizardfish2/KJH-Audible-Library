Not long ago, I was a proud member of the 92nd Legion, the Star Ravagers. We were super-soldiers that defended humanity from aliens, heretics, and otherworldly threats. But a callous betrayal left my legion decimated, erased, and dishonored.</p> <p>I thought I was doomed to spend the rest of my life on a distant penal colony. But when I suddenly find myself stranded in an alien space station, surrounded by the wrecks of lost spaceships, I know I have a chance at escape. But to do so I’ll need to defy the madness inflicted by the station, defeat hordes of man-eating aliens, and crush a cult of lunatics who worship a horrifying god.</p> <p>But I’m not alone. I’ll form a crew of beautiful, dangerous women: a brilliant engineer, an ancient, fragmented AI, and a human-alien hybrid. But the danger we face is beyond mortal comprehension, a threat not just to us… but to the entire Milky Way.</p>";
