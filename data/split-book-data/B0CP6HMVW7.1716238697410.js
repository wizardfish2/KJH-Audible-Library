window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Regular day job - Check. Tedious life in need of excitement - Definitely. A strange magical rift - What can go wrong!</b></p> <p>Ben clocked in and clocked out, living a dreary life until a rip of energy caught his attention. Of course, interfering with the spell proved disastrous and he's sucked into a portal.</p> <p>On Semintor, the fantastical exists alongside wondrous magic. Ben arrives with a massive advantage thanks to his tinkering with the portal that got him there: his Arcana—his ability to cast powerful magic—are downright godly. The man is capable of casting group heals, buffing all sorts of attributes, and more, making him a highly sought after spellcaster, a rare dedicated supporting healer. But... there's a catch.</p> <p>A curse prohibits Ben from harming others or cast spells on himself. Without a doubt he's in a predicament that forces him to use his wit and get a group of strong, loyal people on his side if he's to survive. Thankfully, his charm, good looks, and quick thinking helps him secure the support of two lovely ladies, because the hunt to capture him is on the moment he arrives.</p> <p>If Ben isn't careful, he'll become a chained servant to some petty tyrant, exploited for his unique magic. But if Ben is clever, he'll build a family of powerful women who will do everything to protect each other.</p> <p><b>Join Ben as he navigates Semintor with his augmented magic.</b></p>";
