They have had to overcome everything from their dinner trying to eat them to murderous psychopaths trying to carve out a private fiefdom. Worse, they aren't even aware of the impact the dissent among the aliens running this experiment are having on them. </p> <p>Now, all the survivors seem to want a piece of Jay, which when they are a bunch of hot girls, doesn't seem entirely bad. He just has to sort out who is trying to manipulate him and who wants to be on Team Jay - all the while, finding a way for humanity to survive.</p>";
