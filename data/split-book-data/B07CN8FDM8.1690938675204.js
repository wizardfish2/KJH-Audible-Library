window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On Ludus, life is often cheap. Nora's childhood hadn't given her many options. With nowhere else to go after losing her family, she joined an old friend in a street gang and found an unlikely home there.&nbsp;</p> <p>But unfortunately, tragedy is about to befall Nora. Grudges from the distant past and movements of shadowy organizations may take away everything she is familiar with and all that she holds dear...possibly even her life. Danger has never stopped her before, but survival may require escaping her old life and embarking on an insane, desperate journey. On the way, she might even accidentally stumble into both an incredible opportunity and an incredible burden. Unfortunately for her enemies, Nora was no pushover before...and that was before discovering super powers!&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
