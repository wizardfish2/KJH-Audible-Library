window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One geek against the rising darkness.</b></p> <p>Bill Ryder is having a hell of a week. Magic is back, one of his friends has been entombed in solid rock, and he once again has no pulse to speak of. Too bad it’s about to get worse. </p> <p>Something is hunting vampires in New York City. A smarmy wizard has been called in to investigate, one with skeletons in his closet and eyes for Bill’s girlfriend. All the while, neolithic horrors - not seen since the dawn of time - are reappearing, wreaking havoc wherever they step.</p> <p>Bill will need to rally his friends, both new and old, if he’s to have any chance of turning the creeping tide of chaos threatening to drown his city. But it won’t be easy. The balance of power in the supernatural hierarchy has been upended, and all the attitude in the world might not be enough to fix it.</p> <p>Bill the vampire is back in <i>Everyday Horrors</i>, the second book in the Bill of the Dead series that puts the comedy back into horror comedy. If you enjoy the snark of Shayne Silvers, Steve McHugh, Michael Anderle, or Jim Butcher, then you're in for one hell of a bloody fun ride.</p>";
