Basically, this ex-succubus comes along, ropes me into a whole ordeal that involves fighting off her old team of supervillains or aliens, whatever you want to call them.</p> <p>Just the two of us? No way in hell! We had to form a team first, and what a team!</p> <p>But I won't spoil the fun for you, friend. Listen on.
