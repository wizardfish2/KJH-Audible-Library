window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It took everything to defeat the feared Natom Hilgresh. Turns out, that was the easy part.</b></p> <p>Now the clock is ticking for Clive to return to Far Reach and prepare for the second coming.</p> <p>Of course, it isn’t exactly a Sunday stroll. Navigating unforgiving terrain across the war-torn country of Kalabri, the vast armies of Destruction and Justice swarm the land, killing everyone in their path.</p> <p>But there is strength in numbers and by offering a safe haven to those displaced by the carnage, there’s a real chance of binding them together into a force dangerous enough to slaughter its way home.</p> <p>For if there is one thing you can say about war, if it doesn’t kill you, it will give you plenty of XP.</p> <p><i>Immortal Shell </i>is a LitRPG/GameLit portal fantasy set in a chaotic land ruled by ruthless Gods. It is complete with game mechanics, progression system and empire-building. A place where demons, werewolves, dwarfs, and elves roam. Warning: Despite their best efforts, these individuals are driven by anger, fear, and lust, and as a result their journey is full of dark humor, violence, and profanity.</p>";
