He helps a few villagers, defeats a feral goblin, and then somehow absorbs mana from a legendary scroll.</p> <p>Reed can now learn magic—blazing fireballs, shield wards, and more. But it comes with a cost—a mission leading him to dangerous dungeons and treacherous mountains, to take the artifact to its tower and defeat a centuries-old demonic threat.</p> <p>In this realm of dancing jesters and dragon riders, he’ll need a good party by his side. What better ally than a cute, thousand-year-old elf bard? She’s seen it all, and she sees something in him. They’re soon joined by a buxom knight maiden, eager to draw her blade and fight beside him.</p> <p>With a sword in his hand and the magic in his veins, can Reed and his close-knit party defeat the demon obsessed with dominion?</p>";
