window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Wholesome. And whole wheat.</b></p> <p>Gavric Restweary, the Nephilim Reborn, has vanquished a legion of Hell singlehandedly. At the end of his quest, a gleaming jewel awaits him—the Duke of Terror's Soulstone. But it was never intended as a reward.</p> <p>Now forced by the Heavens to bear the Soulstone himself, Gavric must find a measure of peace by taking over his mother's bakery, lest Diabolicus escape his prison and corrupt the land anew. A heavy burden for one man to bear, but doing so gives him hope that he may live to find some reprieve from his trauma.</p> <p>He won't be alone, however. Kyrael, Rose Maiden and Angel of Innocence, the sole daughter of Tyranor the Golden, soon arrives outside Torstram as a falling star. Her mission? Watch over the hero and the Soulstone. But just how will the dynamic between the Angel and the Nephilim unfold? Will they find peace and comfort together, or will Gavric succumb to the Soulstone?</p> <p>Action. Connection. Peace. Adventure. And lots of bread. This book has it all.</p>";
