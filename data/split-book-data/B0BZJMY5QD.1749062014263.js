Until, that is, he could find someone to tell his story. All of his story.</p> <p>Easy enough, on the surface. However, revealing the truth of his origins will put his mother’s soul at risk, and he’s trapped in his realm alone. To share his story at all, Chalmys is forced to connect with bards through dreams, and after centuries of tangled tales gone wrong, he has nearly given up hope.</p> <p>Until the night he connects with her.</p> <p>Holly has two things going for her: her daughter Violet and her freelance writing business. Unfortunately, she also has a manipulative, freeloading ex and plenty of bills to pay. When a gorgeous and powerful mage appears in her dreams, insisting he needs her help, she worries her stress levels have risen a bit too far.</p> <p>But when Holly is forced to choose between her mundane world and his magical realm, suddenly nothing is as simple as it seems. They’ll have to find a way to work together—or neither will be free.</p> <p>If only a certain god doesn’t interfere …</p>";
