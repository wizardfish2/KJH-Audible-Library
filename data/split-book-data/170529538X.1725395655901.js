A war was on the horizon, and every weapon would matter, so losing even the most inexperienced warriors was an unthinkable prospect.</p> <p>The Empire had never prepared for battle on such a massive scale before. They'd gathered tens of thousands of Spirit Knights and hundreds of thousands of Heaven Soldiers in just a short time. But would that be enough to combat the countless hordes of the enemy? Or were these just the death throes of a once vast Empire?</p> <p>Hadjar, whether he wanted to or not, would be part of this upcoming war. Moreover, his role might end up being far more significant than he'd originally assumed.</p> <p>Before a decisive battle begins, he must plunge into a maelstrom of war preparations, which doesn't bode well for him....</p>";
