That is, until he gets an offer to be a part of an experiment for a major scientific research company. All he has to do is get cryogenically frozen for a few years and he'll be rich. What could go wrong?</p> <p>Quite a bit, as it turns out.</p> <p>When Jack's pod splits open and he's met by two beautiful women, he's introduced to a very different world from the one he left behind. There are warring tribes, mutated animals, actual monsters, and even ogres. With so many threats, how can anyone hope to survive?</p> <p>Lucky for Jack, being frozen was only half the experiment. The other part is swimming around his bloodstream, and it's turning him into something more than human.</p> <p><i>Warning: This story contains adult situations, coarse language, and other fun things.
