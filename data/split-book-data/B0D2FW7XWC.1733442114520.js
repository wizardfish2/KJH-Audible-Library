window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a village of lazy, good-for-nothing Cobalins, one manly man—a true studly stud—stands above them all: the great, the powerful, the King of…Knock.</p> <p>(Desley palms her forehead. You no be King of Shadows! Now we have to start over. Cobalins groan.)</p> <p>The terrible Army of Light knows the secret location of Dedu Tedu Novus. War is here. There's absolutely no avoiding it.</p> <p>Or is there?</p> <p>Naturally, Dhane does the most unthinkable thing: employs an impromptu plan, his favorite type. It's dangerous, it's crazy, and it embarks them on a new adventure where it rains every day and the problems don't stop.</p> <p>Can he save his village? Can he convince Challenger Sarah to help? Or is he only putting off the inevitable, the point where the Changed Reditai turn all those of Shadow into stone for their mysterious plans?</p> <p><b><i>Tropical Hazard</i></b><b> is the third installment in the hilarious—and sometimes serious—Arachnomancer series.</b> Travel to a new zone, see the world, and eat spider tacos. Octoralis glares. Or… umm… don't. Don't do that last thing.</p> <p><b>Notice:</b> Arachnomancer was rated M for mature by a team of immature Cobalins. Listen at your own risk.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
