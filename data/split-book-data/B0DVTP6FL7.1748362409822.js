Grow stronger.</b></p> <p>After being killed by a high-velocity tree-hug, Arlo is transported to a new world where those brave and talented enough to conquer ancient Delves are rewarded with incredible power and abilities.<br> <br> Unfortunately for Arlo, there is no tutorial. He is immediately forced to tackle a Delve set to the highest difficulty with a party of adventurers who are not only strangers to him, but strangers to each other as well.<br> <br> Arlo has no armor, no weapons, no knowledge of the world at large, and his party is growing increasingly suspicious of his lack of preparation and paper-thin excuses for how he got there.</p> <p>There's also the fact that the System in charge seems to be treating Arlo's situation like a big, cosmic joke.</p> <p>Determined not to die <i>again</i>, Arlo forgoes putting any points into his highest stat, Intelligence, and instead dumps everything he's got into Fortitude. After all, who needs equipment or fighting skills when you can eat fireballs for breakfast and still ask for more hot sauce?</p> <p><b><i>Mage Tank</i></b><b> begins a new Isekai LitRPG adventure that features steady progression, intelligent characters who spend time making intentional build choices, and tons of laughs. It’s not action all-the-time, but Arlo’s life is replete with danger and, more importantly, consequences.</b></p>";
