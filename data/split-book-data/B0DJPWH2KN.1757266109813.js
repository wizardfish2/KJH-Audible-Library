window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I can't believe it! I've really been accepted into the Royal Scouts? For real?</b></p> <p>It's a dream come true for a farm boy like myself, to gain access to the Portal Halls and be able to explore the worlds beyond. More than that, it means I can finally provide for my family. After all, they're the ones who put their savings on the line so I could get a chance to join this prestigious guild. And if I may be at a disadvantage compared to other recruits, as all I know is how to grow beans, I plan on boosting my skills as soon as possible.</p> <p>You see, our mission as Scouts is simple: dive into one of the many portals lining up the halls of the Portalway, map the area, and get out of there before the timer runs out. But the reason we're charting those realms in the first place is to locate Eon Stones—stones that grant the wearer magical powers, from the ability to regrow a limb to giving you near invisibility. And if I can sell my surveys for cash, I can also use those stones to empower myself and move up the ranks!</p> <p>There's the thing though… No one knows exactly which portal leads where until someone dives in first. It could be a strange land where the physics run differently than here; it could be lush or desolate, beautiful or terrifying, with dangerous fauna or even monsters the stuff of nightmares…</p> <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself here. I'm still a Browncloak, or a newbie if you like, and so I'm confined to the first floor until I get some experience under my belt. So it shouldn't be too hard. Or should it? They wouldn't want to send a novice to his death now, would they?</p> <p>*Unlocks portal*</p> <p>Here goes nothing!</p>";
