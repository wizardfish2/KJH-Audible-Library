window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Since Lady Luck had sent Doc to this weird, western world, a lot had happened. It started in Deep Gulch, a small mining town in what he would have called Colorado if he’d been on Earth. Doc hit the ground running, making enemies and friends from his very first day.</p> <p>With Luck beside him, Doc went to work improving the lives of those he counted as friends. Despite his enemies having both money and power, in the end Doc was the last one standing. When the dust settled, Deep Gulch was well on its way to becoming a beacon of progressiveness in the west.</p> <p>Before leaving the town of Deep Gulch, Doc found himself facing some difficult decisions; the most difficult was leaving behind potential children, just in case the worst happened and he died. If those children were born, they would give Luck the chance to continue freeing the world from the Darkness trying to kill it.</p> <p>His second decision was to ordain his near-adopted daughter, Posy, as a priestess of Luck. As a gift from the goddess, she gained the power to heal. Doc knew that she would be a bright point of hope in the town.</p> <p>The future was mostly unknown, but he had a destination to start with: Furden, the capital of the Coalrud territory. Getting there would also allow him to marry Sophia. She’d been a key part of his success in Deep Gulch, and he was looking forward to her joining their family.</p> <p>What would happen in Furden and the plans for what would come after were unknown, but Doc has Luck behind him, his family beside him, and a world that needs saving.</p>";
