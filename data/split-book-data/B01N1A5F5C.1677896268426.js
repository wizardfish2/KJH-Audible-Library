window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The climactic final volume of The Venom Trilogy by <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author Shannon Mayer.</b> </p> <p>Humble baker-turned-supernatural Alena Budrene is lovely and lethal, and for the first time, she's owning it. Finally rid of her low-life ex-husband, she's free to date sexy vampire mob boss Remo, who respects her as both a Supe and a woman. She's on good terms with her difficult mother, and she's growing comfortable with her powers. </p> <p>But just when it seems things are falling into place for Alena, Hera strikes again: the Aegrus virus rages across Seattle, threatening the life of everyone in its path - including Remo, infected by Hades. The only way to stop the carnage is to face Hera and her army in a no-prisoners battle to determine the fate of the human race - and Alena's future. </p> <p>In a sweeping voyage from the Seattle bar scene to a netherworld populated by murderous gods and monsters, Alena confronts one adversary after another on a quest to set the world right for both humans and Supes and demonstrate her power - to the gods and to herself - once and for all. </p>";
