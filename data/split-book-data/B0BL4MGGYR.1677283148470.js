window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Yanked from cryo to join a crew of modded humans in deep space? Daisy's life just got a whole lot more complicated.</b></p> <p>As if nearly burning up in a freak accident on her way to Earth wasn't bad enough, Daisy had a whole mess of other trouble on her plate. Big trouble. And she was going to get to the bottom of it if it was the last thing she'd do, which it was starting to look like it very well might be.</p> <p>The thing is, Daisy had a simple rule for space travel. Don't blow up, and so far she'd been managing to abide by that, but mere survival wasn't enough.</p> <p>With the powerful AI supercomputer guiding the craft beginning to show some disconcerting quirks of its own, and its unsettling cyborg assistant nosing into her affairs, Daisy's unease was rapidly growing, as was her bigotry toward artificially intelligent beings. Add to the mix a crew of mechanically enhanced humans, any one of whom she suspected might not be what they seemed, and Daisy found herself with a sense of pending dread tickling the periphery of her mind.</p> <p>Something was very much not right, she could feel it in her bones. The tricky part now was going to be overcoming her biases and figuring out what the threat was, before it could manifest from a mere sinking feeling in her gut into a potentially deadly reality. Only things were quite different and much worse than she could ever have imagined, forcing her to repeatedly adjust and overcome a reality that turned out to be far from what it had originally seemed. And it was looking like Daisy wouldn't have to save only herself, but the entire planet Earth in the process.</p> <p>The complete series set of all five of the Clockwork Chimera books:</p> <ol> <li><i>Daisy's Run</i></li> <li><i>Pushing Daisy</i></li> <li><i>Daisy's Gambit</i></li> <li><i>Chasing Daisy</i></li> <li><i>Daisy's War</i></li> </ol>";
