window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two necromancers, a dwarf kingdom, and a sky city - it sounds like a prelude to mayhem, and given Timmy’s luck, that’s exactly what’s going to happen.</b></p> <p>To keep his castle and earn his pardon, Timmy has his work cut out for him. Whether it’s rescuing princesses, crushing hordes of goblins, or dealing with eldritch abominations, Timmy and the gang are there to save the day - and rob the occasional crime lord.</p> <p>But saving the day isn’t always easy. Timmy might be an eminently sensible necromancer, but he has to deal with a young dragon who is convinced that every problem can be eaten, an elf obsessed with property damage, an ancient vampire who can’t get through a mission without being impaled repeatedly, a semi-retired legendary swordsman, a bureaucrat who has finally mastered the art of screaming and swinging a frying pan, and an overly ambitious apprentice doing her best to be more menacing despite loving the color pink.</p> <p>It’s hardly a surprise when things don’t exactly go to plan.</p> <p>With war on the horizon, Timmy and the others have their hands full. Rescuing a princess can be difficult at the best of times, but rescuing a princess from one of the most powerful crime lords in the world? That’s going to be tricky.</p> <p>And that’s not their only problem. Ever wonder whose job it is to deal with rampaging hordes of goblins that are about to overwhelm a kingdom of dwarves? Well, that’s Timmy’s job. Isn’t he lucky? On the upside, he finally has an excuse to deploy another army of zombies. He’s going to teach those goblins a very important lesson: Never, ever get into a war of attrition with a necromancer.</p> <p>One necromancer is dangerous. Two necromancers with a dragon, a vampire, a swordsman, an elf, and a bureaucrat - that’s downright deadly.</p>";
