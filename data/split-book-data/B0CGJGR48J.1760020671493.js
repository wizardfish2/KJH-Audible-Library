A will to challenge fate.</b></p> <p>Three months have passed since the battle against the High Guard, and Felix and his people have grown. He’s poised on the brink of ascension to Master Tier, and his Stronghold is a burgeoning city; echoing with commerce, affluence, and the influence that comes with it.</p> <p>Felix cares for none of it.</p> <p>His Companion Pit remains cursed. Wings lost and wounds unable to heal, every remedy they try on the grounded creature only brings a fresh round of despair. It consumes all of Felix's attention, to the point that only the threat of the Corrupted Unbound—Imara—can force him away.</p> <p>The huntress has only a singular prey: the Unbound known only as the Ashen Gnome, whom she intends to personally deliver to the Hierophant.</p> <p>Should the Gnome fall into her clutches, everything Felix has built would be destroyed—and there’s not a chance in hell that he'll let that happen.</p>";
