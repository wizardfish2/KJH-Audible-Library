window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Syl was given a choice by Gramps when they died. Reincarnate as a regular person or embark on a daring experiment. Driven by a desire to honor Gramps and a sense of adventure, Syl chose the latter... only to awaken as a lowly slime.</p> <p>A farmed slime.</p> <p>The life of a farmed slime was cruel. Syl was constantly at the mercy of humans, a slime whose only purpose was to eat and recycle garbage. The threat of lethal core-destroying knives wielded by innocent children was a constant shadow. This was not the life Syl had envisioned. So, they made a daring escape to the wilderness!</p> <p>Along the way, Syl discovered the joy of eating everything they encountered. But the local monsters weren't too thrilled with another creature moving in. Humans, dwarves, and elves see monsters as nothing but experience. Goblins see Syl as an exploitable resource.</p> <p>With the odds stacked against Syl, the question of their survival loomed large. Could they not just survive but thrive? Could they unlock new magic and integrate new slime cores? The future was a vast, uncharted territory, but Syl was unwavering in their determination to explore it, no matter the challenges that lay ahead.</p> <p>And the biggest question of allâ€”</p> <p>Can Syl make any friends?</p>";
