window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Big picture, everything was going swimmingly. Little picture wise, an ancient Dragon is now roaming the realm, a country full of martial artists will have to migrate, someone moved one of the moons and permanently altered Eira’s oceans, ruined the teleportation network, shut down city barriers, and caused unimaginable havoc all over the realm. There was also the significantly more real not-too-distant Sun demon, the ever-evolving threat of Krists, wars between nobility, strange weather phenomenon’s, some nonsense involving Poppy, and no matter how much time passed Sylver couldn’t shake the feeling that he had forgotten something.</p> <p>But, big picture, Edmund was alive, Chrys was mastering her magic, the dark elves had a place to live, Lola had a big project in the works, Sylver made three new friends, Ria made one, and in further good news, Sylver finally managed to get 1,000 undead under his command. At the current rate of one Ibis member per 2 years, on the time scale of an immortal Lich, Sylver was basically done. Hopefully Eira would still be in one single donut shaped piece by the time he was actually done, but that was a separate, small picture, problem.</p> <p>Book 6 of this Fantasy LitRPG Series about a reincarnated necromancer growing in power and finding his way in a new world where the rules have changed vastly since he last \"lived. \"</p>";
