window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Humanity put all its fading hopes in New Eden, a pristine star system 230 light-years from the ravaged Earth. But upon arrival, the would-be colonists encountered the Kresh - a diabolical alien race who quickly captured the human starship and tortured its inhabitants in hopes of learning the coordinates of Earth. </p> <p>Street-smart Cyrus Gant managed to escape, crashing to the surface of a nearby moon terraformed by the Kresh and inhabited by primitive humans. Now Cyrus pursues a desperate hope bound up in a single boy, a prophesized psionic named Klane - already in the clutches of the Kresh. Soon Cyrus finds himself torn between tracking down this so-called savior and escaping back into space before it's too late. Yet as he gathers allies and firepower, he's desperate to find a way back to Earth and warn them of this alien menaceâ€¦ only to discover an even greater danger to the future existence of the human race. </p> <p>The electric interstellar action that began in <i>Alien Honor</i> continues in <i>Alien Shores</i>.</p>";
