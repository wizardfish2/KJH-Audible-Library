Pity for her that reality has other plans, especially since it's on the verge of collapsing.</p> <p>Demonic entities are destroying the portals linking Earth to the multiverse. When the last one falls, all life as we know it will end. Sadly, with each connection severed, the supernatural beings of our world grow weaker. As their power fades, so too does their chances of stopping this cataclysm once and for all.</p> <p>Tamara will need to muster both her strength and burgeoning magic to make one last stand, but it won't be easy. The forces marshaled against her grow stronger with each passing day. If even an army of witches and werewolves can't defeat them, what hope does one girl have against an unstoppable tide of evil?</p>";
