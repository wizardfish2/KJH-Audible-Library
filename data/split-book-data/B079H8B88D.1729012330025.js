window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Being left behind to hold the fort every time the world needs saving, sucks.</b></p> <p>For Carmella Hunter, a witch blood with practically no magick, being surrounded by powerful friends has taken its toll. For once it would be nice to be the one doing the saving. Stuck in a dead-end job in Piccadilly's favorite bakery, Carmella spends her days making cinnamon rolls and her evenings feeding the homeless, all the while dreaming of making a difference.</p> <p>One huge pastry order for the Covens annual meet and an attack of flu germs leaves Carmella delirious with a fever - too delirious to avoid a fateful bargain with a djinn named Paimon. Bound to do his bidding, his seductive voice in her head and his infuriating arrogance make the partnership a trying one. With Paimon, Carmella gets her first taste of power. A power she must use to track down the monsters hunting Paimon's people. Suddenly Carmella isn't so helpless anymore.</p> <p>Things get complicated when her boss, and close friend, goes missing, and the enforcement agencies don't seem too bothered about looking for a celestial dancer who likes to sleep around. With the help of Mal Banner, the Piccadilly Coven Elder Witch and self-professed playboy, Carmella finally has the opportunity to be the hero she's always wanted to be.</p> <p>But someone doesn't want Carmella digging. Someone will go to any lengths to make her stop.</p>";
