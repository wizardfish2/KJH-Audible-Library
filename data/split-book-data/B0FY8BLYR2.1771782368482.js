But my new power has earned me a new enemy: an ancient vampire prince with a grudge, and he's just fast-tracked my trial by combat...to the death.</p> <p>I have a handful of levels, a sarcastic magic sword, and two fairies who believe in me. He has centuries of power and a guild of corrupt politicians on his side. They think a numbers guy can't win a magical war. It's time to prove them wrong.</p>";
