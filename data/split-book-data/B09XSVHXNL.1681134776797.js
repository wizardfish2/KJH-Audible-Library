window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Alex has come a long way in the fantasy world he now calls home. His sole skill has proven to be pretty overpowered, and he's built up some eyewatering stats during his grind of the dungeon. Not to mention he has two beautiful mages at his side.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now that the business with the Beastkin is over, they plan to head on back to the city, victorious. There's just the minor problem of getting back there, and once they do, perhaps Alex can finally return to the grind.</p> <p>If only things were so simple.</p> <p><b>Author's note: Inspired by light novels, RPGs, and manga. Contains isekai, light LitRPG/gamelit stats, dungeons, magic, and a touch of trope.</b></p>";
