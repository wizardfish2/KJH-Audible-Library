The lost underground city ready to invade the world.</b></p> <p>Jim and his friends are heroes, having closed the gate opened by a dark mana demon. As battered as they are, their work is nowhere near complete. It isn't just humans that can go insane, and saving the world doesn’t mean there aren’t other plots afoot that could destroy the Empire.</p> <p>Now shipwrecked and with no knowledge of his location, Jim has to find a way to stop a threat even he had never seen before. An infection is spreading, something beyond anything even the gods warned him of, and the team must find a way to cut it out before it spreads. If they fail, the dead will assimilate everything in their path.</p> <p>There’s no way the heroes can risk holding back.</p>";
