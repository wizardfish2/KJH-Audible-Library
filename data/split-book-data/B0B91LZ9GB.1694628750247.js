window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The race to claim the Worldbranch Throne has begun.</p> <p>Now the site of EBO’s first completed Red Cathedral, the Onyx Delta has become the center of the virtual world, and the entire player base is descending on Ned’s city to try their hand at the fearsome new raid and reap the game-changing rewards within.</p> <p>At the same time, a powerful, menacing guild is running roughshod over the western continents, razing every city in their wake and winning Frank’s obnoxiously loud approval from afar. But Ned knows that it’s only a matter of time before their forces sail east to the delta and attempt to burn down everything he’s built.</p> <p>There will be blood...again, but more this time.</p> <p>There will also be substantially more cats.</p>";
