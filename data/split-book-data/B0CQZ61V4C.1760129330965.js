First, I need to secure alchemical ingredients for Cynthia, my resident alchemist, so we can start making and selling potions. Second, I must find a wand maker to broaden the range of items we offer in the shop. Then, there's the issue of that magical tattoo parlor I want to set upâ€¦ For that, I will need someone to teach me the basics of tattooing so I can gain a rank or two and make full use of my new ability.</p> <p>It seems I can't stay out of trouble long enough to make headway. I'm not even back from my trip to Rence when I'm thrown into some fairy lands and get stranded. I'll soon discover that the Giantskarl is not the only dungeon in my neck of the woods and that I will have to put everything on the line to get out of there in one piece.</p> <p>But so is the life I chose, and I will do whatever it takes to build my Merchant Empire!</p>";
