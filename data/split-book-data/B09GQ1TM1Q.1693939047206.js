Unbeknownst to Nimon, Jax and the vast majority of his people are far out to sea, aboard ships that are only partially operational, and the enemy's forces are drawing closer to his home by the hour.</p> <p>Jax must choose: Protect the refugees and risk the Dark Legion reaching his home first, or take a far smaller force and intercept the threat head on. Can Jax risk it all on a single roll of the dice?</p> <p>What Jax doesn't know is that he's not the only one of Imperial Blood to have skin in the game. It's time for the brothers to finally meet on the field of battle....&nbsp;</p>";
