Things ain’t actually all that bad.</p> <p>I mean, last year was pretty hectic.

And I got married. Pretty neat, huh?</p> <p>Well, this year, after the Spring Planting season, I’m <i>really</i> gonna relax and put down roots. It’s the slow life for me. Sure, the talking animals and cultivators coming to live with me are a bit weird, but this year everything is gonna be basically<i> normal.</i></p> <p>There <i>definitely </i>won’t be any Heavenly Tribulations, ancient formations, or cultivator issues to deal with . . .</p> <p><b>The second volume of the blockbuster progression-fantasy series—with more than 20 million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
