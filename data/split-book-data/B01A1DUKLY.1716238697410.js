window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sam Sharp has never been what people would call sociable. Affected profoundly by his father's death when Sam was very young, he developed into a solitary and self-sufficient person. When he finds himself transported to Gythe, a world that is completely different from his home, yet strangely familiar, he is forced to seek help. Sam's nature wars with his need to rely on the strangers he meets - a warrior, a scholar, a monk, and a telepathic creature - to help him find a way back to his own world. </p> <p>When Sam finds that he has an affinity for the peculiar vibrational energy that exists in Gythe, he realizes it is his only chance for going home. But there is only one person who may have the knowledge to help him: the Gray Man, a tyrannical vibrational energy master with plans to rule the world. Can Sam trust others to aid him and to prepare him for the ultimate confrontation with the Gray Man, to learn the secrets of this mysterious adversary? If so, will he even be capable of using the vibrational energy himself to return home, or will he die in this strange new world? </p>";
