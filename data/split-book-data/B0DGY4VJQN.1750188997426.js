A gambit to restore a broken alliance.</p> <p>Duncan and his girls have uncovered a demonic plot to destroy the last remnants of civilization, but they have no hope of stopping it on their own. Yet to assemble the army they need, they must set aside old grudges and forge an unlikely partnershipâ€”not only with the woman who cast Duncan into the Condemned, but with a man who wants to destroy the Dread Knights once and for all.</p>";
