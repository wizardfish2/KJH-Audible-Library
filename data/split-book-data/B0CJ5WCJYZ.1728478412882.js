window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Everything had changed for Zander Greaves over the last few weeks.</b></p> <p>He'd gone from being a private military contractor with his squad in the Middle East to being isekai-ed into a different multiverse.</p> <p>He lost his friends and his lover, Selda, in the same hour of his arrival, sparking in him the mission to kill every single Entoma he could to repay them for his loss. Luckily, an alien named Crish arrived to help Zander adjust to his new reality.</p> <p>His first few days were a chaotic mess as he tried to adapt, but it was his first day on board the ship <i>Fractured Dreams</i> that Zander discovered what his new life would be. He was one of the lucky one-in-ten-thousand: a person whose body accepted an AI of Antecedent technology. His AI, however, was special, taking on the memories and persona of his former lover, Selda Engel.</p> <p>With Crish's and AI Selda's help, Zander came up with a mad plan to displace the pilot leader, Shivatin the Rakshasa, and take over that position. He had experience staying alive as a mercenary and used that to forge the fractured crew into a cohesive new whole.</p> <p>As he was finally taking on the mantle of leader, Shivatin led a mutiny to take the ship from the captain and to kill Zander. The Rakshasa had no clue what he'd unleashed in doing so; Zander led his new team in a repelling action, killing the invading boarders, then pushing on to the bridge to take out Shivatin.</p> <p>Veldiami, the captain of <i>Fractured Dreams</i>, took it one step further, boarding the other ship that helped in the mutiny to claim as salvage. It only took killing four—including the ship's captain—to secure it as loot.</p> <p>Left on the other ship, the <i>Righteous</i>, to guide it to the nearest galactic hub, Zander made a deal with the remaining crew. They used the FTL drive to reach the hub that day, meaning Zander would find himself alone on MX Hub for two days before <i>Fractured Dreams</i> and her crew arrived.</p> <p>What trouble could a human—completely out of his depth in a new universe <i>and </i>on an alien space station—get into before his crewmates arrived?</p>";
