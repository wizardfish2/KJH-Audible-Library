I am the Icon, the Shining One, the last defender of humanity against the oncoming tide of darkness. </p> <p>They say my coming was foretold, that prophecies speak of a beacon of hope who will light the way during the end days. It is said I am destined to vanquish the last of the Magi, and face the Night Spawn in the final battle for the fate of mankind. </p> <p>If only things could be so easy. </p> <p>Despite all my power, I am afraid. And if I can't conquer my fear, face my demons, and overcome the feelings I have for a man I must destroy, then I shall be utterly consumed and the world will know endless suffering for my failure. </p>";
