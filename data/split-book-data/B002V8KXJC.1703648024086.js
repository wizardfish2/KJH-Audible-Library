window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Honor Harrington has survived ship-to-ship combat, assassins, political vendettas, and duels. But this time, Honor and her crew, ambushed and captured, are aboard an enemy ship, bound for a prison planet aptly named \"Hell\" - and her scheduled execution. </p> <p>Yet the one lesson Honor has never learned is how to give up. She and her people are going home - even if it means conquering hell to get there! </p> <p><b>A Note from Author David Weber</b> <br> There's been some confusion—not to say, um, energetic debate, readers and fans being readers and fans—about the correct pronunciation of \"Manticoran.\" The truth, alas, is that a stitch was dropped. An error occurred. A mistake was made… and it wasn't Audible's fault. It was mine. Before Audible recorded the very first Honor Harrington book, narrator Allyson Johnson and I not only corresponded by e-mail but actually spoke to one another by phone. She wanted to make absolutely certain she had the correct pronunciations for names, places, star nations, etc., and I tried to make certain all of her questions were answered. And so they were. Unfortunately, at some point in the process, I replied to one of her e-mails by telling her that \"Man-ti-core-ahn\" was pronounced \"Man-tik-er-ahn.\" Exactly how this happened is more than I can say at this point, except to blushingly disclose that the original e-mail remains intact, confirming to all the world that it was, indeed, my fault. I can ascribe it only to a temporary mental hiccup on my part and crave your forgiveness. If, however, you must blame someone for the mix-up, that someone should be me and not Audible, who have done everything they could to get it right.</p>";
