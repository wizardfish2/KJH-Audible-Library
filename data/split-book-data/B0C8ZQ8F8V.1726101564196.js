window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Four friends work together to break the system and make the world a better place in this cozy, fun-filled fantasy-adventure filled with twists and turns.</b></p> <p>In the Prime Kingdoms, the system dominates everything. It dictates one’s strength, skills, and power. It spawns dungeons and guides the actions of their monsters. But every system has its limits, and it’s about to push four oddball adventurers to theirs.</p> <p>First there’s Derivan, an enchanted suit of armor in the middle of an existential crisis. And then there’s the tanklike half-orc Misa, who loves exploiting the system but misses her family—unlike the anxious-but-lovable Vex, a lizardkin wizard who’s run away from his own. And lastly there’s Sev, a cleric who would rather have tea with his god than worship him. None are prepared when a simple quest goes off the rails, interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious dungeon linked to each of them.</p> <p>Something is deeply wrong within the Prime Kingdoms. The system is malfunctioning, and the world itself seems to be falling apart. If Derivan, Misa, Vex, and Sev hope to survive—let alone determine the source of the chaos—they must rely on their trust for one another, share their secrets, and perhaps even engage in a bit of healthy communication.</p> <p>Now if only everyone else would do the same . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with almost two million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
