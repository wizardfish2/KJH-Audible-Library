The subtle periphery between dream and reality is in peril, and those chosen must face the evil behind this looming disaster. </p> <p>But lurking in the shadows, guiding their hand, lies the true threat - and a hidden agenda. Can they discover the truth in time, or will would-be-heroes become nothing more than pawns of evil?</p>";
