For others, it marks the beginning of a long journey.</p> <p>On his nineteenth birthday, Leland Silver was offered a portion of a Lord's power. The only issue… it was from a Lord no one had ever heard of—the Lord of Curses.</p> <p>Teamed with his two best friends—a Legacy of the Berserker and a Legacy of the Chameleon—Leland must learn quickly if he wishes to get anywhere in this newly opened world. Together, the trio will lead a relatively normal young adult life: protecting caravans, killing mana-lions, learning to play the harmonica, and forging contracts with gods.</p> <p>You know, the usual things nineteen-year-olds get up to.</p>";
