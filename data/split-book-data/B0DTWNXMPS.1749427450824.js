window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Every thirty years, an ancient god hosts a very dangerous game.</b></p> <p>After Ryder Copeland wakes in a hospital after a suicide attempt, two people immediately try to murder him. A woman named Juliet saves his life and then reveals that he succeeded in his suicide after all. They’re both dead, but a mad god has granted them five more days of life... if they’re willing to kill for it.</p> <p>Thirteen teams of former suicides now have five days to kill each other, after which Lyssa, the divine progenitor of this death game, will reincarnate the single surviving team into luxurious new lives. Stranger yet, Juliet had the chance to watch Ryder’s life after she died, and now, she’s in love with him.</p> <p>Ryder can’t imagine falling in love with a woman he just met, let alone killing for her. Yet as they fight other teams of doomed lovers across the urban sprawl of Washington, DC, he can’t let Juliet die. He has to play Lyssa’s game to save a woman who loves him, but he can play it his way: by challenging its god.</p>";
