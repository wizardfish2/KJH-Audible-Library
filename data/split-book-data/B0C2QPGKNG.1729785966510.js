Whispers that monsters from myth have reappeared to terrorize the land spread like wildfire, and the legend of an ancient sleeping dragon begins to stir.</p> <p>It’s up to EDGE Force—a clandestine organization that leverages the best and brightest humanity has to offer—to defend against threats that can’t be fought by traditional means.</p> <p>Six months have passed since the events of Mori Island that changed JD Rideout’s perception of the nature of reality. For the first time in a long time, life is good. Kaiser has joined his family, and together they’ve been waiting to be called back for another EDGE Force mission.</p> <p>After the call comes, JD takes up the mantle of Hatchet once more, but this time he’s fighting as part of an EDGE Force team. Led by the battle-hardened leader Xiphos and supported by deadly companions, Hatchet must find his place in the chain of command and fight back against the cosmic threat festering beneath the surface of the Carpathian Mountains.</p> <p><i>Claws of the Dragon </i>contains Aussie slang and LitRPG elements, including level-ups, skill increases, new abilities, and a deep crafting system.</p>";
