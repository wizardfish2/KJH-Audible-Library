window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“You keep what you kill. That’s one law everybody out here respects.”</p> <p>Twenty years ago, the Merge brought armies of monsters flooding into the West Coast.</p> <p>Dungeons popped up in shopping malls, airports, and Starbucks. Walls were built to contain the spread, but the promise of priceless loot dropped by the creatures inspired a new type of gold rush. Magical weapons, powerful gear, potions to cure every ill...If you survive long enough to kill the mob, whatever they drop belongs to you.</p> <p>Clay Jaeger has nothing left outside the walls. Civilization took everything he worked for, chewed it up, and spat it out. Now Clay, his wife Alex, and his beer-loving, chainsaw-toting brother, Joe, are going west to try their hand at monster killing.</p> <p>The loot from the low-level mobs is enticing, but it isn’t the real reason they risked the Infested Zone. They need to kill a Dungeon Lord. Only one in 10,000 hunters pull it off. The rest become fertilizer for the wasteland. But the few who beat the odds gain riches, glory, and most importantly, the Dungeon Lord’s magical powers.</p> <p>They have nothing left to lose and everything to gain. If they survive.</p>";
