window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For thousands of years, the ConFed has been the most powerful force in the quadrant. It is the umbrella under which hundreds of planets and trillions of beings live in relative peace...despite the corruption and waste, it's a system that most accept as preferable to the chaos that would ensue in its absence. </p> <p>Rumors have swirled around about the demise of the ConFed for as long as Jason Burke had been in space, a lone human among countless alien species. He largely ignored them...until now. For the first time since any of the members of Omega Force can remember, someone may have figured out how to destroy the ConFed without directly engaging its powerful military. </p> <p>As one crewmember's past seems connected to the current trouble, Jason must decide what side of the fight he's on...let the ConFed die and plunge the quadrant into chaos, or swallow his pride and try to help an institution he despises maintain its power for the greater good. </p>";
