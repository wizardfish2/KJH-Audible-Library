window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'm Lucian Colt, and this story is mainly about me punching zombies in the face. Loads of 'em. </p> <p>You'd think that life would be easy-breezy for a handsome, demonic badass like me, but you'd be wrong. The demon doesn't help me with rent, doesn't help me pick up chicks or anything fun like that. Instead, he's all about violence. Lots of it. So, when this super-powered necromancer shows up in town and starts emptying the city's graveyards, my buddy Gadreel thinks it's go time. Before the Veiled Order knows it, a war is about to break out between the living and the dead. Pretty scary, eh? </p> <p>Oh, and get this! Turns out that this Demon-Heart gig isn't all it's cracked up to be. The guys who stuck this infernal organ in me left out the fact that, someday, when I die, I'll be heading straight to Hell. Ain't that a bitch? </p> <p>Join me as I kick some major ass, have an existential crisis, get shot down by cute girls, generally mess everything up for my friends and, just maybe, come out of the deal having learned how valuable my teammates are. It's going to be a wild and filthy ride! </p> <p><b>Trigger Warning:</b> This book has a lot of guns in it, and sometimes, their triggers get pulled, resulting in devastating headshots. If you're not into that sort of thing, or if you've got issues with dirty words, dirty thoughts or talking spiders, then slowly back away from this book and retreat to your safe space. Wouldn't want you to get your feelings hurt. </p>";
