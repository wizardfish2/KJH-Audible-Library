window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Revenge, they say, is a dish best served bloody and twitching.</p> <p>For Kellik, nothing matters so much as defeating his father and destroying his reign over Port Gloom.</p> <p>But as powerful as Kellik has become, his father will surely crush him if he doesn't stay three steps ahead. Toward that end, he'll have to employ every ounce of cunning, break every rule, wrest ever advantage, and bring the very fury of the Hanged God down upon Port Gloom.</p> <p>Burning with a furious desire to crush his opponents, Kellik will return with his gorgeous rogues' gallery of companions to attack the ancient city from all sides: Using politics, assassinations, betrayals, and outright warfare, he'll stop at nothing to ensure his father's downfall.</p> <p>He's willing to risk it all. But is there a price to victory even he's not willing to pay?</p> <p><b>Warning and minor spoilers: This is an 18+ audiobook intended for mature listeners.
