And not without good reason. The confrontation with the good sheriff made sure of that. But when the dust cleared, there was still work to do, and only one person who could reasonably do it.</p> <p>But it's not just bandits going bump in the night. The goblins are stirring up trouble, an adventuring team has come to town and a certain Nightmare might just be friendlier than she first let on. Trouble just can't seem to stay away.</p> <p>And when a trip to Beenleigh goes terribly wrong...</p> <p>Calon will find himself pushed into situations with lasting consequences. So it's a good thing when he summons a couple more friends.</p>";
