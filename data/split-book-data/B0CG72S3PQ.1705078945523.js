Well, when a mysterious ailment begins sweeping through the neighborhood, I begin to doubt that.</p> <p>There's a strange atmosphere in our idyllic little community, but my reaper form is just the tool for the job—slicing through bones and stealing souls, it also works great on the lawn.</p> <p>Did I mention my house has come alive and turned into a beautiful, petite spirit babe? She’s worried about the mysterious force lording over monsterkind.</p> <p>I’m shoveling snow and fixing leaks while an even greater threat looms. See, there's this council…</p>";
