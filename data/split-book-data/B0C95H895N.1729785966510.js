This time, he's ended up in another worldâ€”the world of the Spirits and Fae. The General has already been here before, but he's never tried to do something as audacious as stealing a treasure from one of the Queens.</p> <p>What will this latest adventure lead to?

But their aid might just be too costly to attain.</p>";
