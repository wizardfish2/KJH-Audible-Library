His mother cried out for Ashe to leave her as she couldn't continue on, but he was defiant to her pleads. He finally obeyed his mother and fled as fast and as far as his little legs could carry him, but he wasn't fast enough.</p> <p>Ashe is saved and brought to another world by The Goddess of Light's High Priestess and her knights. He ends up with a new name, new identity, and a new family.</p> <p>This is a story that has magic, sword and sorcery, and some litrpg elements, but is definitely not heavy with it.</p>";
