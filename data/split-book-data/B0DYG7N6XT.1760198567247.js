What new foes will rise up to face Clan McLaughlin? And will Desmond and his family be ready to face them?</p> <p>Monster Girls In Space is a Sci-Fi, fantasy, semi-military, men’s romance, progression fantasy about a man becoming a space-wizard amongst a universe full of monster girls (it’s in the title, you should have expected that part).
