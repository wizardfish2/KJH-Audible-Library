Left alive by the men who butchered his family, Arbor has two options: give up and perish, or rise up and fight to take back the life he's lost. To do that, though, he'll have to leave behind the only home he's ever known and venture out into the world beyond.</p> <p>What he doesn't yet realize is that the world is a much more dangerous place than he could ever have imagined. A world filled with magic, monsters, and mythic beasts powerful enough to destroy entire nations!</p> <p>Warning: Contains mild profanity and content that may not be suitable for children.</p>";
