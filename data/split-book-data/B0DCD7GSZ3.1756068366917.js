Or roll over and die.</b></p> <p>Too bad for them, Warren isn't the rolling-over type.</p> <p>Cancer may be kicking Warren's a$$, but he's not about to let aliens destroy his home and everything he loves (which is mostly just his dog, Buck). Besides, what does he have to lose?</p> <p>Better to die with sword in hand, bleeding out from a head wound than in some hospital bed...</p> <p>Once the games begin, Warren can't help but think, \"Maybe hospital beds aren't so bad after all.\"</p> <p>Nah, F that! If you're going to go out, might as well go out having an impaled taraza (whatever the hell that is) at the end of your blade.</p> <p><i>Obelisk: System Integration is an action-packed, epic, LitRPG apocalypse series. Our heroes face off an alien invasion, academy politics, PvP, and tower ascensionâ€”all to save Earth from being destroyed.
