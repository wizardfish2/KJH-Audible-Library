window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>If you think having one dragon around messes up your life, imagine what it’s like when a second one shows up.</b> </p> <p>I’m Val Thorvald, assassin of magical bad guys and tenuous ally to the dragon lord Zav. </p> <p>He still calls me a mongrel and thinks I’m a criminal, but he healed my wounds after we fought those dark elves together. That’s progress, right? Maybe one day, he’ll deign to use my name. </p> <p>Not that this is my primary concern. I’m busy with a new assignment. Nin, the awesome lady who makes my magical weapons, has a werewolf problem. Specifically, sleazy loser werewolf competitors who want to drive her out of business. Or worse. </p> <p>Normally, a couple of werewolves wouldn’t be a big deal, but these ones have powerful allies. And then there’s that new dragon. </p> <p>It turns out he’s one of Zav’s enemies, and he wants to use me against him. </p> <p>I don’t know why he’s picking on me — it’s not like I mean something to Zav — but somehow I’ve gotten stuck in the middle of dragon politics. If you think that sounds like a nightmare, you’re right. </p> <p>If I can’t figure out a way to help my friend with the werewolves while keeping these dragons from tearing me apart, we’re both going to end up flatter than the deck chairs when Zav lands on the roof of my apartment building. </p> <p>Pick up <i>Battle Bond</i>, and continue the adventure today!</p>";
