It took a lot of sweat and coin, but I managed to bring the Karl back to a functioning dungeon.</b></p> <p>With my adventuring shop running in full swing, now's the time for the second part of my plan: building New Valley. All that's left for me to do is wait for the lumber I ordered to arrive so I can stake the land, start expanding, and… What? What did you say? My cargo's been stolen?</p> <p>As I start investigating the incident, it becomes increasingly clear that someone's been sabotaging my efforts on purpose… and that someone is taking advantage when I'm away to claim every last parcel of land in New Valley! I try to negotiate with him, but that ruthless competitor will stop at nothing to take everything I've worked so hard for.</p> <p>Follow me as I go out into the world looking for a way to stay in the game and, in the process, summon spirits, broaden my repertoire of runes, and delve into new dangerous parts of the dungeon.</p>";
