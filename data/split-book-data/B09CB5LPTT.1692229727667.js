window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Army of Earth is being sent on its first tour of duty. Its 50,000 proud and valiant troopers are the best of the best, full of hope for brilliant victories and spoils of war that can help Earth's humanity along in its development.</p> <p>There's just one little problem, though. The operation's Geckho commanders view their human vassals as mere cannon fodder, good only for plugging up holes in their defensive line and shipping out to the space war's most punishing hotspots where the chance of surviving is practically nil.</p> <p>How should the King of Earth behave in this situation? Disobey the suzerains' orders, draw their ire, and put his home planet under threat of complete annihilation? Or make a play for the freedom of humanity in a game of his own?</p>";
