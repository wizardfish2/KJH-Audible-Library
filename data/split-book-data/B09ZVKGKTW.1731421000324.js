I made friends, but also enemies, and got myself into a death duel. </b></p> <p>Our triumph from defeating the dungeon’s first floor boss was short-lived, however, as a rather grim notification popped up.</p> <p><i>What did it say?</i></p> <p>A colossal beast and its swarm of bloodthirsty monsters was headed our way. That was the bad news. The good? We had time to prepare. I have my own party now, made up of a feisty earth girl, a naïve but lovable moon elf, and a larger-than-life giantess. Who also happens to be a princess. We need to find a fifth member to round out the party before it is too late.</p> <p><i>What do we do?</i></p> <p>Cultivate strength. Form alliances. And hope we’ve got what it takes to save Sklava City.</p>";
