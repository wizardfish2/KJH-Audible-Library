window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The final battle is at hand. </p> <p>The North is under siege by Octagon the Bitter and his horde of twisted monsters. All but two cities have fallen and their forces are dwindling by the day. With little choice remaining, Morgan sets out on his own to try and convince the rulers of the other Kingdoms to join in their cause. Convincing rulers who have been at each other's throats for centuries will not be easy, and Morgan has doubts as to whether they'll even listen. Still, for the sake of everyone in the Five Kingdoms, he has to try, even if it costs him everything. </p> <p><b>Warning: This book contains profanity, gore, and content that may not be suitable for children.
