And he doesn't remember his password. </p> <p>He, like everyone else in this nightmare, had his memory scrambled or lost in the process of being loaded into the game. A single garbled message is his only clue to how to save everyone. </p> <p>The problem is that whoever loaded them into the game loaded their minds completely. If they die, their brains get wiped. </p> <p>Now it's time for Runner to flex his skills as a power gaming min maxer and see what he can do. Because every time he levels, he might gain the memory of the password. Time to go hardcore. </p>";
