And a powerful weapon left behind by a long-dead alien civilization.</b></p> <p>How could I turn down a galaxy-spanning adventure with all this and more?</p> <p>It started out just like any other job, stealing an artifact of unknown origin for a beautiful client. Turns out, that client was literally not of this world, and the artifact was the key to the kind of life I'd only seen on the screen.</p> <p><b>A life filled with diverse cultures, stunning alien women, and me with a starship all of my own.</b></p> <p>It's the stuff of dreams, but this new life comes with dangers to face as well.</p> <p><b>It isn't just the Earth, but a big chunk of the galaxy that's at risk!</b></p> <p><i>Earthman Sentinel </i>is the first in a found starship series that is intended to span the galaxy and more. It's a lighthearted, male-oriented space opera where magic coexists with science, and it follows our heroes on a mad-cap adventure full of space battles, alien monsters who shoot a lot but can't seem to hit much, and impossible odds with incredibly high stakes if they lose!</p>";
