My confusion only grew as I explored this new world–a future that was nothing like I ever could have imagined.</p> <p>It didn't take long for me to learn that humanity was extinct and that I was now in the hands of a stunning AI, a siren with camouflaging powers, and a monster girl who happens to be a great engineer–beings that are as fascinating as they are strange. These creatures have managed to build their own society, but it isn’t a safe one. Marauding space pirates are a constant threat, seeking to capture and exploit these new forms of life for their own gain.</p> <p>As I learn more about this world, I realize that I have a new family–the women who took me in. They need my help, and I’m more than willing to provide it. I’m a veteran, after all, and I know how to protect those I cared about.</p> <p>If it was just about my girls, I could get used to living here.</p> <p>But the girls are constantly in danger–and the longer I’m here, the more I realize I would do anything to protect them. I need to take charge of this dreadnought and learn how to navigate this strange, new alien world.</p> <p>These space pirates might be ruthless, but they are no match for my determination.</p> <p>Humanity might be extinct–but I’m only just getting started.</p>";
