window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Large chests are said to encompass all manner of hopes and dreams. Men covet them. Women envy them. But one fact holds true - everyone wants to get their hands on some big ones. </p> <p>The same holds true for one intrepid adventurer - a strapping young lad by the name of Himmel. Armed with his grandfather's trusty longsword and the dream of being the strongest, he sets out on the journey of a lifetime! It is sure to be a long and dangerous road, fraught with danger! And it all starts with a simple test - reach Level Five in the dungeon called the \"newbie zone\" and earn the right to become a full-fledged adventurer! </p> <p>However, such things get hopelessly derailed when his adolescent mind beholds an exposed chest for the first time - a fateful meeting that would inevitably lead his life in a direction he never even dreamed of! </p> <p><i>Content warning:</i> Gore, violence, explicit sexual scenes </p> <p><i>Everybody Loves Large Chests </i>was first brought to Jeff Hays on <i>Soundbooth Theater Live</i>, his live streaming narration show. Since then, it has been the most consistently requested and enjoyed title by fans. So much so, that Neven Iliev finally decided to approach us to put out a full audio version of the first arc in Boxxy's adventures! </p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater team for this production: </p> <p>Jeff Hays - Narration, Characters, Production Supervision <br>Dalton Lynne - Proofing<br>Alex Tate - Production, Editing, Mastering </p>";
