Moreover, it's nothing but one headache after another with the authorities.</p> <p>And even though I wrested my castle back, the neighbors aren't going anywhere, and they live and breathe to tear off chunks of my land, and eliminate me, the new head of the family.</p> <p>There's just one thing I don't get.

Something's on fire!</p> <p>Well, I'll show them . . .</p>";
