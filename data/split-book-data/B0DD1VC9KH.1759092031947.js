Nick and his growing guild are training against time to be ready to stop this “Red Death” before it ever happens, but no one outside Nick’s closest circle knows this true purpose behind their intense tactical team-combat exercises. The secret weighs heavily on Nick as he considers revealing the truth of his regression to his found family, the Walters, and his other allies, hoping they will believe him and still support him when he needs them most.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the preparations for the Red Death take Nick and the Daedalus Guild on a mass, multi-team raid on the medieval Ecto Sanctuary dungeon, a battlefield of vengeful specters and bands of roving undead. The adventure promises levels, skills, and rare loot—if Nick can get everyone home alive.</p> <p>But the undead are a simple-if-lethal threat compared to Nick’s cousins, all angling to best Nick and each other in the upcoming competition to decide the heir to the Gallows dynasty. Allies and enemies could be one and the same when Nick receives an offer that changes the game completely and could make or break Nick’s world with the Red Death only days away.</p> <p><b>When time weighs heavily, it's time to hit the weights in this regression LitRPG/Gamelit story of dungeon-diving, leveling stats, and facing down the apocalypse!</b></p>";
