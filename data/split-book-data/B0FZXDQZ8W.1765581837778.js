window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When a ghost hijacks your VCR, there’s no pause button on the madness.</b></p> <p>Running a VHS store was supposed to be easy. Just me, my emotionally unreadable co-owner Emiko, and rows of dusty tapes nobody rewinds anymore. But then a pink-haired girl dropped off a 'top secret' tape and told me not to watch it.</p> <p>So, of course, I did.</p> <p>Now I’ve got a ghost living in my VCR. She's gorgeous, possibly insane, and apparently bonded to me through something called Biomance—a long-lost life magic that heals wounds, gives endless powers, and might be making me a god.</p> <p>Since that tape, nothing’s been the same. Emiko’s acting weird. Syble’s whispering in my head. And a shadowy agency might be watching my every move.</p> <p>This complete story collects the full chaotic ride—supernatural powers, haunted tapes, sarcastic banter, sensual ghosts, awkward romance, and endless hijinks.</p> <p>If I’m stuck with a cursed tape, a clingy ghost, and magic powers I don’t understand…I might as well hit play.</p>";
