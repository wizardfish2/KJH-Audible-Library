window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A Dreamstalker - a creature that stalks and kills its victims in sleep. A fairy in law enforcement determined to stop him. A potions smuggler who possesses something she wants. A vampire with his own agenda. And a partner who couldn't possibly be sexier or more frustrating. </p> <p>Dulcie O'Neil is a fairy working in law enforcement for the Netherworld. When Knight Vander approaches her with a case regarding comatose victims, she agrees to help him, imagining the most difficult part will be combatting her attraction to him. What Dulcie isn't betting on is the case becoming personal - but all the victims are somehow linked to her. When her best friend falls victim to the Dreamstalker, Dulcie must do everything in her power to ensure her friend's survival, including associating with criminals and accepting the fact that desperate times do definitely call for desperate measures.</p>";
