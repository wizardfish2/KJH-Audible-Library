Once again, venture into the mysteries of Madra: The planet stuck on hard mode.</b></p> <p>All Jiran wants to do is delve ever deeper into the depths of density and mana—the cornerstones of the magic that permeates his world. Unfortunately, his powers have grown far beyond what anyone could have foreseen. His mentors, unable to shelter him from those who seek to abuse his knowledge, have chosen to flee and whisked him away to the far corner of the empire.</p> <p>Their efforts are futile, as there are omnipotent forces at play beyond their comprehension. To them, Jiran simply stands out too much, and like the proverbial nail, he’s about to discover that Madra is the mother of all hammers.</p> <p>Beset on all sides by predators far outside his weight class, and stricken with an ancient malady that both empowers him and counts down to his doom, Jiran will once again have to bend every disadvantage in his favor to survive. But for the only boy willing to blow himself up for science, it might as well be just another day of the week. And what’s a planet to do when every time it kicks an <b>-ERROR-</b> down, it comes back stronger than before? Control him for its own machinations, of course!</p> <p>As unforeseen events unfold, and all his plans go awry, Jiran is thrown into an adventure beyond his wildest dreams, one filled with far-off lands, new cultures, personal growth, and something or other that’s epic, I assure you.</p> <p><b>Don’t miss Jiran as he blasts through this second installment of the wildly popular Density God series. He’ll make new allies and enemies and discover unimaginable secrets buried within him, all while cheerfully blowing the top off his power. Hopefully, before the world of Madra once more throws him bodily into the fire.</b></p>";
