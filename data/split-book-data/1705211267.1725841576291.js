window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eddie Hunter isn't stuck in the game <i>Light Online</i>, but if he wants to keep his job, he needs to stay there. It's not a hardship for him as he increasingly believes that his in-game life is far preferable to his out-of-game life. Working on a hidden development quest that he discovered by accident has him becoming more and more entrepreneurial even while running his own inn, but between him and his party, the Meadowlands is rapidly developing. </p> <p>The goblins from the Forest of Fools have noticed the Meadowlands growing stronger as well and start attacking out of the forest. They seem to be growing stronger as the Meadowlands do. The Meadowlands themselves are changing also, offering more challenges and rewards, as Eddie completes more of his quests. </p> <p>Eddie finally decides that he can't keep everything going on his own. Between running an inn, building the things necessary for his quest, adventuring, and more, he's getting to the point where important things are slipping his mind. When a dungeon is discovered in the Meadowlands, where there was never one before, he gives in and relegates himself to an assistant in running his own inn so that he and his party can test themselves against it in an attempt to grow their own power levels.</p>";
