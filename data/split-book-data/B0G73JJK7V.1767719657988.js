Not only are there massive Apertures called Calamities consuming large portions of the landscape, but most of his friends are also scattered to locations unknown around the Kingdom. Worse yet, they have no idea who he is because of the Dominion magic used on them before he was transported to the Empire.</p> <p>Despite those setbacks, Larek is determined to reunite with both his friends and his family. Problems arise almost immediately upon entering the Kingdom, however, as he is presented with a delay of his reunion with them all. As a result, he is forced to adapt to the sheer devastation he finds himself surrounded with.</p> <p>Through it all, there is one truth that is becoming more and more evident as time goes on. As powerful of a Fusionist he may be, Larek also struggles with fighting and anything more than basic combat tactics, as his skills in that department are sorely lacking. It’s time to learn how to fight instead of just flailing around, swinging his axe and hoping that his higher stats will carry the day.</p> <p>In other words, the Fusionist needs to undergo a much-needed Martial TransFusion.</p> <p><i>This weak-to-strong MC story contains LitRPG elements such as character progression and statistics, as well as a heavy crafting emphasis. No explicit sexual content or harems.</i></p>";
