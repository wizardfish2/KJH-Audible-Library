But now, it was time to help her through everything else.</p> <p>In the wake of the attack on Point City by Daeva, the military had devised a plan to insert Melody into Daeva's stronghold. To gain entry, Melody would have to use her new looks and put her best villain act on.</p> <p>Miles was always there to help his ladies when they needed it, including assisting Melody in this nebulous project.</p> <p>But fresh troubles cropped up for Miles at the Bureau of Superheroes, as Beatrix looked for him and files he'd had her delete from her computer, and she turned to their incendiary boss, Kim, for help. Was Miles' secret on the line, or would he manage to fly under the radar of these two superpowered ladies? Either way, Miles could not allow anything to stand in the way of his plan.</p>";
