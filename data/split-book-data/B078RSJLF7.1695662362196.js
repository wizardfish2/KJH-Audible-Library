The history of Second World, in contrast, seems to have simplified its path to a ring from which there is no apparent way out. </p> <p>An unforeseen invasion lays waste to whole provinces, prompting the game's most powerful clans to ally with the emperor's guard to stop the monstrous hordes in their tracks. A war erupts that nobody saw coming, shattering the tedium of peaceful life. </p> <p>All the while the world's most elusive character - once a lowly miner, now a powerful mage - finds himself in an impossible situation, and sorely in need of allies of his own as he searches for a way out. </p>";
