window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At a glance, the dwarves and gnomes of the Horkensaft Kingdom are two peoples who are worlds apart. The former are seen as hardcore traditionalists hell-bent on maintaining the status quo, while the latter only look ever forward and upward as they grasp at the future with both hands. And yet, these two seemingly opposing cultures serve as a counter-balance to each other, creating a civilization that draws upon the wisdom of the past to face new challenges. Whether that is actually the case or mere propaganda will soon to be put to the test, as they are about to receive a visit from the Hero of Chaos. The enigmatic herald of change has already fostered a well-deserved reputation for setting things in motion by their presence, and only time will tell if the Kingdom of the stout-folk will survive the impending transition.</p> <p>Though, once again, Boxxy doesn't actually care what ripples it causes. It isn't there to upset society or challenge the stagnant culture of all-work-no-play. Its goal is to track down an errant treasure that escaped its grasp while it was out of commission, and maybe secure some new pieces for its ever-growing collection along the way. Before it has a chance to, however, it must first deal with a significant issue that threatens to undo much of its work since its arrival in Azurvale. It is a challenge unlike any it has faced, and not one that it can hope to solve easily through force and violence. The limits of Boxxy's patience and self-control are about to be tested, as it looks desperately for a way...to leave the house.</p> <p><b>Content Warning: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content</b></p>";
