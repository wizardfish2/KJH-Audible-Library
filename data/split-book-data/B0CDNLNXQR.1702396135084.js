window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nab the criminals, enjoy a pint, and avoid being the hero destiny demands!</p> <p>Lennox chased scum across the galaxy, bringing them to justice until one day, a target generates a very illegal black hole to flee through. Unable to escape it's might, Lennox is ripped from everything he's ever known and brought to a fantasy world with a system interface.</p> <p>On Komax, two forces battle in a never ending war. The Scaly Faction consist of lizard people, their fearsome pets, and their allies of mythical monsters. The Ordinatus Faction consists of elves, dwarves, and humans who repel attacks, eradicate nests, and try to gather enough supplies to survive the peaceful winters.</p> <p>Lennox's years of training and hardened body transfer to Komax in amazing ways. His stats are incredibly high, his space items become a legendary weapon and armor he doesn't toss out. Oh, and Lennox starts off half a foot taller than the average man.</p> <p>However impressed the locals are, their jubilance or jealousy lands flat. Lennox isn't big on being a hero, enjoying being left alone to do whatever the hell he pleases. To him, fate can sit and spin while he tips back a frothy ale as a fabled lone wolf. The problem is, fate is indeed fickle and life seems to find a way of thrusting heroes into daring situations they'd rather avoid.</p> <p>Join Lennox as he adapts to his new fantasy world!</p>";
