window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If the destruction of Earth and extinction of humanity were imminent, how far would you go to survive? Would you kill your body to save your mind?</p> <p>Jack Mitchel is willing to risk everything to survive the apocalypse — including his essential humanity.</p> <p>An EMT in 2042 San Diego, Jack knows he won't survive the impact of the massive asteroid hurtling towards Earth. After all, he's not one of the handful of lucky lottery winners scheduled for rescue. But he did luck into a NexGenVR capsule, which means Jack can risk a one-way trip to the virtual reality world of Viridan Gate Online, a completely immersive online multiplayer fantasy role-playing game, or RPG.</p> <p>The transition to Viridian Gate Online (V.G.O.) is irreversible, and will kill Jack's corporeal form. And once players transition fully into the world of V.G.O., the risks aren't over — from cutthroat fellow players to greedy developers eager to replicate the wealth discrepancies of Earth in virtual reality, V.G.O. is just as dangerous as the 'real world' was. If Jack can’t game the system, he’s going to be trading in a quick death for a long, brutal one....</p> <p>LitRPG books combine tropes and themes from role-playing games with sci-fi and fantasy elements to tell a unique story that's exciting and super-relevant to today's world. Jack's adventures in a cutthroat virtual reality fantasy world will grip fans of <i>Ready Player One</i> and <i>The Stormlight Archive </i>alike. With over 200,000 copies sold, this is one series you don't want to miss!&nbsp;</p>";
