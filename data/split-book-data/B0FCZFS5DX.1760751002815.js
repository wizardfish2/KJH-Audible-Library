window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Andy \"Duke\" Ellington was an exceptional fighter pilot with a habit of biting off more than he should have been able to chew. Yet, somehow, he always came through it - whether that was luck or skill was an open debate. This was his life as political tensions rose and boiled over into military action. At least it was until it wasn't. He pushed too hard and too far and the end came for him.</p> <p>And then...he was Elsewhere, in a completely different world with no support and only a marginal clue. Things like magic and stats were his new reality and he had no choice but to learn how to adapt. But he was \"Duke\" or \"The Duke\" as many called him. He lived his life on the edge and he would do no different in this world.</p> <p>Imprisoned Archmages, corrupt rulers, mysterious forces from beyond, and ancient dungeons all wanted a piece of him. He was happy to take them all on. He would show everyone just who he was and what happened if you messed with \"The Duke\".</p>";
