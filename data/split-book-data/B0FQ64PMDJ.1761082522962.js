Now on Earth once again, their levels outstrip the colleges they were attending.</p> <p>However, that isn't stopping the Headmistress from trying to put them back into the classroom.</p> <p>As they dive once again, going into Star City and beyond they are coming up against new races and Felin is reunited with the nekorian race, though the meeting doesn't go quite as planned.</p> <p>Ken has to weave between uprooting the remainder of the SJS Financial web, following the rules of the Orkai and not collapsing under Crimson's renewed training efforts. At least he has his party of five once again, Penny filling in for Fayeth as she returns to the elven world to help her people recover from their own disaster.</p>";
