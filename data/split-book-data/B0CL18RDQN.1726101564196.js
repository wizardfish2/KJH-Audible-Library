window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'd known my fair share of tragedy in the last year. Lost my family, abandoned by my friends... things were looking down. Imagine my surprise when I get ripped out of my own reality and forcibly enrolled in a magic school nestled between the seams of the multiverse. My new purpose? Defend all of creation against the Outer Gods and keep from dying at the hands of the Void Things.</p> <p>But there's something nefarious about my headmistress... something I don't trust. At least I'm not alone anymore. I've started attracting women that are as gorgeous as they are powerful, and somehow my new magical abilities have bonded us together. A vampire, a chick who's apparently the daughter of a star (not sure how that works), and even a half-demonâ€”my love life is a lot more colorful than it used to be.</p> <p>But the stakes keep getting higher and higher. Death, dismemberment, and the collapse of the multiverse all threaten to make date night a thing of the past. The worst part? Only I have the power to do something about it.</p>";
