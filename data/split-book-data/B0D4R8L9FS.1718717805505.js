window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The complete series in a single offering </b></p> <p>Zach Riley is a man on the run… from something, or someone, that he just can’t figure out. What, pray tell, might that be? Women who are around him want to jump him, and get him into bed. But Zach can’t figure out why! He simply can’t take it anymore, so he escapes, taking refuge in his own spaceship and he never, ever, leaves it. But his comfortable, if lonely, lifestyle is suddenly thrown into chaos. Little does he know that he has nanobots inside him, that are controlling his pheromones. That’s what made women desire him so much!</p> <p>One issue: these Nanobots? They’re illegal. And anyone found with them is hunted and killed, so as to prevent the universe from ever going through another Nano War. As such, Zach is pursued by the authorities. With the help of his ship’s AI, he tries to escape an almost-certain death sentence. However, as he’s fleeing to another dimension where he knows he will be safe, a God snatches his up ship during the transfer. Things never go as planned, do they? And now that God is asking Zack to help bring true magic back to his realm.</p> <p>Will there be consequences for doing this? Probably. But at the moment, Zach has no idea what they could be. Rewards? Sure. What are the requirements? Well, it necessitates sleeping with a bevy of beautiful women who aren’t human, but who are just as stunningly gorgeous as their human counterparts. One of the rewards will be to have riches beyond his wildest dreams… if he grabs that brass ring and goes for it. Zach needs to teach magic to others, but first, he needs to start with women. It’s a good thing that Zach has no problem being with women—lots of women—human or otherwise. Because, in this dimension, aliens are the norm, and here, he is the alien. To the women of this world, that makes him quite exotic.</p> <p><b>Join Zack as he learns that the Nanobots inside him make him very unique in controlling energies, including Magical ones. One day, that particular ability may let him restore something that has been lost for eons.</b></p>";
