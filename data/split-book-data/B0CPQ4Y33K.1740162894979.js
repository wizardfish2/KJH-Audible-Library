window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the aftermath of the demon invasion, Ilea makes her way to Riverwatch to find a home for a wayward mind weaver (ensuring he doesn’t eat anyone along the way). After traveling, reuniting with old friends, and some light punching, Ilea's life, it seems, is slowly returning to normal. But dire news awaits her upon her return to Ravenhall.</p> <p>A friend is in danger, and there is work to be done.</p> <p>The trail leads Ilea to the Empire and beyond, to dark alleys and ancient dungeons, to unknown desolate lands beyond the frontiers of humanity, and to the ruins of a long-forgotten Kingdom.</p> <p>There are old allies to fight with and new ones to be made; an excellent maker of cakes, a fiery fox with a sweet tooth, and an… unlikely historian. Ilea will need all the help and levels she can get, to beat down both beast and man (and occasionally the weather too), for her enemies are many, and not every fight will be as simple as just another Drake. </p> <p>A long journey is just beginning, and she may be surprised where it ends. Hopefully, there is some good food along the way…</p> <p><b>About the series:</b> Join Ilea as she is transported to a world full of monsters and magic, where power is measured by one's class, level and skills. Watch her grow in power, and recklessness, as she wields ancient hand-to-hand combat magic that can both heal and destroy. This Isekai story has a dual-Class LitRPG system where every skill, class and ability can evolve. Ilea’s tale is equal parts comfy slice-of-life wanderings, goofy jokes and brutal, blood-pumping battles with nightmarish monsters. Join her as she delves into forgotten dungeons, hoards snacks and generally does whatever she feels like.</p>";
