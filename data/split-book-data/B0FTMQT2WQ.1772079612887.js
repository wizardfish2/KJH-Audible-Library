Sometimes, being an Inquisitor really sucks.</p> <p>After completing his first mission, John finds himself trapped in what looks like a zombie apocalypse. This new mission seems simple: stop the zombies, save the world, and maybe get the girl. No problem!</p> <p>Things are never that simple in the Doorverse, though. John's native talents in this world set him against the dominant religion, and if he's found out, he'll probably be executed. His mark—whoever they are—knows he's coming and hunts him at every step. And getting the girl turns out to be a lot more complicated than he imagined.</p> <p>Everything seems stacked against him, and without the powerful allies he had on his last mission to aid him, John's more or less on his own. Death and a fate worse than death await him beneath the triple moons...</p>";
