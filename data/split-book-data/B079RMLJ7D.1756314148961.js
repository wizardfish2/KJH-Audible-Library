Instead, William has unwittingly earned the raptor gaze of even greater foes. One is someone he thought he could implicitly trust while others are even more dangerous. And all are from the island of Sinskrill. They are mahavans, powerful magic users bent on humanity's enslavement. They seek to capture William and chain him to their needs, to bind him in perpetual servitude upon Sinskrill. </p> <p>William finds himself caught among people for whom deceit and pain are simple coins to be traded, and his best hope to survive these new challenges might lie with someone he'd always thought to be his mortal enemy. </p>";
