window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Captain Kat Falcone owes her life and career to her former right-hand man, William McElney, and she did everything in her power to make sure he was front and center for a promotion. But now that he has it, she fears he'll have to watch his back. Captain McElney has been assigned to HMS <i>Uncanny</i> - nicknamed <i>Unlucky</i> - a heavy cruiser tainted by the mysterious deaths of two former captains and rumors of mutineers. Nevertheless, as the interstellar war with the Theocracy rages on, the <i>Uncanny</i> will travel in tandem with Kat's starship, HMS <i>Lightning</i>, to the notoriously lawless Jorlem Sector to forge alliances for the Commonwealth and quash rampant piracy. </p> <p>As Captain McElney struggles to whip a hostile crew of miscreants into a disciplined fighting force, Kat is saddled with an undermining new executive officer - an untested aristocrat whose bigotry colors his sense of duty. Both captains wage war against ruthless pirates while conspirators aboard the <i>Uncanny</i> plot to seize the ship. When the starships find themselves locked in a death match with an enemy juggernaut, Kat must make a desperate and devastating sacrifice. </p>";
