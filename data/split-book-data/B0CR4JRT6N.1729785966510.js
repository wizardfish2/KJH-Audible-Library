window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the first book of this thrilling isekai adventure series, a human becomes a dungeon—and soon that dungeon becomes something much, much more . . .</b></p> <p>The usual result of a human taking a runaway semitruck head-on is a very sudden, very fast track to the pearly gates. But for one newly noncorporeal man, there's another option: become a dungeon. Feeling sorry for the desperate angel assigned to him, the man relents. Heck, if it doesn't work out, he can always chat with Saint Peter about it later.</p> <p>Next thing you know, he's a dungeon. Admittedly, a small run-down, somewhat unimpressive dungeon (more of a house, actually), but you gotta start somewhere, right? Slowly but surely, the new dungeon learns the ropes, building himself up with scions of every creepy-crawly sort he can find; gathering mana; dealing with invaders, delvers, noobs, and annoying guild reps; and gradually becoming a local legend known as Thedeim (get it?).</p> <p>The more Thedeim's power and reputation grows, the more he becomes a part of his new world—and the more its various denizens become a part of his. But how is a proper dungeon supposed to instill spine-shattering, mind-melting terror in a pack of questing adventurers when it's <i>so</i> much more fun to play along with them?</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than seven million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
