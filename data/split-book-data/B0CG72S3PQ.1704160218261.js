I spend mine fighting the neighborhood monsters.</p> <p>After a peaceful vacation relaxing on the beach with my gorgeous demon babes, I return home to be confronted by some crazy new neighbors—and I don’t mean gossipers or HOA fanatics.</p> <p>My house is full of beautiful demi-humans, so a few more monsters around couldn’t hurt, right? Well, when a mysterious ailment begins sweeping through the neighborhood, I begin to doubt that.</p> <p>There's a strange atmosphere in our idyllic little community, but my reaper form is just the tool for the job—slicing through bones and stealing souls, it also works great on the lawn.</p> <p>Did I mention my house has come alive and turned into a beautiful, petite spirit babe? She’s worried about the mysterious force lording over monsterkind.</p> <p>I’m shoveling snow and fixing leaks while an even greater threat looms. See, there's this council…</p>";
