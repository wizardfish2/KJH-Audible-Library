Wildly outmatched, Alfred's forces are on the verge of being crushed. If he falls, there will be little to stop the Shadow Council from taking over the entire world.</p> <p>Charles will need every trick he knows, including a lot of science, some engineering-and maybe even a little bit of magic-if Kortall is to have any hope of surviving!</p>";
