Some will threaten the Onyx Delta, others will offer new opportunities, and one tower in particular will awaken something in Frank that really should have remained dormant.</p> <p>And in the midst of so much change, the Thousand Tower Tournament rapidly approaches, presenting a host of challenges that will pit Ned and Omen against not mobs, but other players, including a formidable new enemy whose cunning and ruthlessness may very well put an end to the guild’s quest for the World Branch Throne.</p> <p>There will be more blood this time, too...again. More cats as well.</p>";
