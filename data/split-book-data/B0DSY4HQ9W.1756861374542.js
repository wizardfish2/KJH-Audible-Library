But aboard the U.S.S. Shotgun Opera, the Overmaiden—a sixth-generation Ghost AI—has just forged humanity’s perfect weapon and best hope: a supersoldier.</p> <p>The man he used to be is gone, lost with his family to demons on the mining world of Aonus. All that’s left is hate, rage, and unyielding power. Rip, crunch, gore, dismember—the unstoppable juggernaut will slaughter his way through Hell, driven by righteous fury and a singular drive.</p> <p>And he won’t do it alone. At his side are an exiled angel, a talented xenobiologist, and the Overmaiden herself—not to mention a battle-hardened squad of marines who've been doing this song and dance for years. Together, they’ll fight, bleed, and bear witness to his wrath.</p> <p><b>He is nameless. He is the Sword of Mankind.</b></p> <p><b>He is the Hellmarine.</b></p>";
