The city obsessed with turning metal into anything one could wish for.</p> <p>While searching the city for Brin’s missing magical items, I literally run into a gorgeous green woman. A goblin girl. Her father, a renowned blacksmith, has been murdered and she needs help finding out who did the deed.</p> <p>With no other leads on how we’ll find our way to dispense justice to the ones responsible for my best friend’s death, we agree to help her.</p> <p>You know what, though? Solving a murder mystery isn’t as easy as the super-sleuths in movies and books make it seem. There’s more going on in the city than just one man being killed.</p> <p>We have our tasks. Solve the murder. Find Brin’s magic items. Figure out how we’re going to destroy the demigod sending shadow monsters to other worlds to drag people to this new world to be drained of their lives. People like me. Like my best friend Lucas.</p> <p>Sounds easy enough, right? Don’t count on it. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that life will kick you in the nuts, given the chance.</p> <p>Well, I plan on doing some kicking myself.</p>";
