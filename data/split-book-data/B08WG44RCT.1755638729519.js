Confined to their homes, millions now survive off drone-delivered food packages and online-only interactions.</p> <p>It’s an especially lonely life for John Chambers, a drone shipment coordinator for the monolithic Chum Corporation. Trapped in his dead-end job, John has started spending much more of his time grinding in virtual reality role-playing games.</p> <p>But when a corporate executive notices the hundreds of hours John’s logged online, he’s offered one last chance to save his job (and his life!). Instead of getting fired, John reluctantly agrees to become prime beta tester for Chum’s top-secret new real-as-life game, <i>New Arcadia--</i>a digital playground inspired by iconic '90s arcade games like <i>Final Fight</i> and <i>Streets of Rage</i>.</p> <p>In <i>New Arcadia</i>, John gets to go back to a hyper-nostalgic 199X and do it right this time. Reborn as digital streetfighter Blaze, John starts cleaning up crime with his fists of fury while also building an online life for himself that seems so much more meaningful than the one he’d had in \"real\" life.</p> <p>But John soon discovers there’s a darker and more ominous purpose behind the Chum Corporation’s new playground--and as he starts to make real friends in this virtual reality, he also begins to realize that what players do in New Arcadia could have dangerous, and potentially life-saving, implications for the real world.<br> <br> <b>Starring</b><br> Eric Jason Martin(Heads Will Roll)<br> Matthew Mercer (Critical Role)<br> Dave Fennoy (Fortnite)<br> Erika Ishii (Ghost of Yotei)<br> Sam Riegel (Critical Role)<br> Dana Snyder(Aqua Teen Hunger Force)<br> Andy Merrill (Space Ghost: Coast to Coast)<br> and John DiMaggio(Gears of War, Futurama)<br> <br> And a full cast<br> <br> Theme by Lloyd Cole<br> Original Soundtrack by Casey Trela<br> Post Production by Mumble Media</p> <p>©2021 Eric Jason Martin (P)2021 Sound Off Productions</p>";
