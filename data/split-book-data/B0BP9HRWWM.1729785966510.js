window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After Magistrate Amerut’s attempt to kill him, Sean knew he still had troubles ahead of him. He knew that removing those who still stood against him would be difficult, but with his friends and family by his side, he started making plans.</p> <p>Sean knew better than to simply rush off and commit murder. He worked to protect those dear to him, using his Talents and knowledge to bend the rules of the world he found himself in—sometimes near the breaking point—to craft new marvels.</p> <p>New doors opened when he healed the sister of Knight Toivo Bloodheart, setting more events into motion. Dame Hallie Bloodheart, for her part, proposed a plan to shield Sean from Lord Sharpeyes’s retaliation. She would marry him, which would raise Sean to the station of Knight.</p> <p>Sean accepted the proposal with his wives’ approval, but first, he married Helga, his Chooser. The former Valkyrie was torn over how she should feel about Sean and treat him, but she loved him and was happy to fully join their family.</p> <p>With two new wives and his intentions set, Sean went to Lord Sharpeyes’ party. Though his plan to force the Lord into a duel was thwarted, so too was Lord Sharpeye’s plan to murder all of his enemies. The battle left many nobles dead and Lady Sharpeyes indebted to Sean.</p> <p>Once all of his troubles in Hearthglen had been dealt with, Sean was ready to move on. While the massive city of Accord was certain to present its own problems, Sean felt confident that he could face them with the backing of his family and friends.</p>";
