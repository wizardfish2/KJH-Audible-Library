window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Things had changed a lot over the last few months for Pawsitively Irregular: Stern had proposed to his lovers, Trish and Cyra, who’d eagerly accepted. That prompted Cammie to stop stalling and admit her own feelings, leading to their new dynamic in a larger relationship. Stern set plans for their wedding, hoping that his fiancées would accept them.<br> <br> But that relationship wasn’t the only one in their crew. They’d met and brought in the angelic Jon Bendersonn and his irregular wife Nicole. The husband and wife had dealt with many of the same problems that Stern had, as her perk required that she keep her face covered by a mask all the time.<br> <br> Now a full crew, the six of them delved dungeon after dungeon together. Their joy over finally having a full crew was tempered by prejudice and hatred— a group of Walkers led by a couple of bigots raised their ugly heads. The two crews had a few minor clashes, leading to the antagonistic group being ejected from a city, further increasing the hatred between them.<br> <br> Stern and his friends didn’t let that stop them from finding their own happiness. In the city of Blackwood, Stern’s family had arrived and held a wedding for their son. It was then that people came to know that Stern was the son of legendary Walker Seamus Masterson, head of Darkhand and the lead crew of Rescue Squad.<br> <br> Stern found himself bemused to end up much like his father: a summoner of many perks, married to three lovely women. They enjoyed their extended honeymoon in Blackwood, but the time for pressing on again was coming fast.<br> <br> Nicole was still hoping to find her perk to be able to take her mask off, and Stern was beginning to doubt his initial goal to push through all the dungeons, no longer feeling like he had to speak to the Goddess. What would happen to the crew when they finally left Blackwood and continued being Walkers?</p>";
