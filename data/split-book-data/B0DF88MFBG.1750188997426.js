window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Slay your foes. Save the damsels. Level up to become the Master of Swords!</p> <p>To face down an unstoppable evil, each kingdom of Occida bound the soul of a young woman to their realm’s most powerful weapons. But the enemy’s final act of treachery teleports away the mythical devices, along with the souls trapped inside them.</p> <p>A century later, Dante Castillo, top dueling performer at the Canterbury Faire, gets yanked off the stage by an impressed goddess. She drops him in the Venetian-style city of Rivoli, where he’s forced to grab the Duke’s prized rapier before escaping into the night.</p> <p>Castillo evokes the fiery and stunning Contessa who’s been imprisoned within the blade. Her aid proves vital, but he’ll need to fight, train, and level up.</p> <p>Beyond the walls of the great city, Dante will encounter elves, beast-kin, dragons, barbarians, and the lost women in need of his rescue!</p>";
