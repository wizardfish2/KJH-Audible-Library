When I arrived on the theme-park planet run amok, I had nothing, but I've built an amazing life surrounded by the women I love. There's no way I'm allowing some tyrannical madman to steal it all away.</p> <p>Nobody said the destined showdown would be easy. We'll have to contend with insane biomechanical monsters, cyberpunk gangsters, and extraversal horrors beyond count! Our journey will take us from the deepest dungeons to dead worlds and shattered realities.</p> <p>Maybe, if we're lucky, we'll get one of those video-game happy endings?</p> <p>Little do I know, this fight will decide the fate of not only Dungeon World but of all realities!</p>";
