window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Min and his dadâ€”on the road!</b></p> <p>Setting out into exile is never much fun, but Minalan wants to publicly comply with Prince Tavard's order to leave Sevendor for three years to spare his home any retribution. Instead of using magic to transport himself to his new lands, Minalan decides to leave cross-country in a wagon with his father.</p> <p>Down the Bontal River, Min and his dad make a stop at Robinwing, get snowed in at Barrowbell, and enjoy a few days as guests of Baron Astyral. Along the way, Minalan comes to terms with many things in his life. With his father's advice and some introspection, he prepares for the great challenge ahead in distant Vanador.</p> <p>No one knows what the future holds, but as the stakes for Callidore grow higher and weigh more heavily on Minalan's shoulders, it might be possible for Min to find inspiration on the Road to Vanador!</p>";
