But we hope we don’t have to.</p> <p>Every winter, the innkeepers look forward to celebrating their own special holiday, commemorating the ancient treaty that united the very first inns and established the rules that protect them, their intergalactic guests, and the very unaware/oblivious people of planet Earth. </p> <p>By tradition, the innkeepers welcomed three guests: a warrior, a sage, and a pilgrim, but during the holiday, the innkeepers must open their doors to anyone who seeks lodging. Anyone.</p> <p>All Dina hopes is that the guests and conduct themselves in a polite manner. But what’s a holiday without at least one disaster? </p>";
