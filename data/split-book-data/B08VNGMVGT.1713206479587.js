window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Contains the first three books in the Dungeon Crafting series! </p> <p></p> <ol> <li><i>The Crafter’s Dungeon </i></li> <li><i>The Crafter’s Defense </i></li> <li><i>The Crafter’s Dilemma </i> </li> </ol> <p>What happens when a knowledgeable crafter becomes a Dungeon Core? </p> <p>Sandra had been a merchant traveling through the human lands of Muriel, though that wouldn’t have been her chosen profession. What she would’ve loved to become was a crafter, producing wondrous creations with her own two hands; however, she didn’t want to become a master in just one craft she was interested in them all. Sadly, she was born with a deformity in her hands which hindered her ability to produce crafts, though that didn’t affect her enthusiasm; she sought out the masters of a myriad of different crafts so that she could learn as much about crafting as she could. It was that pursuit of knowledge that ultimately led to her untimely death. </p> <p>Reborn as a tiny Dungeon Core, Sandra had to learn about the purpose behind dungeons and Cores from an assigned dungeon helper. Through some unique circumstances based on her previous life, she also discovered that she had much more freedom than most other Dungeon Cores throughout the world. Unfortunately, the repercussions of her mere existence would end up being extensive, as she would find, though at first she doesn’t quite realize how much. In fact, the only thing she was concerned about had nothing to do with other Cores, the presence of the different mortal races nearby her location, or even the real purpose behind her being brought back to life as a strange glowing gem.</p> <p>No, Sandra didn’t care about any of that; all she cared about was that she could finally do some crafting. </p> <p>These Dungeon Core stories contain LitRPG/GameLit elements such as statistics, leveling, and a heavy crafting emphasis. No profanity and no harems.</p>";
