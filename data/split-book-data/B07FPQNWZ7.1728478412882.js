When he’s told his gaming scores are good enough to qualify him for a brand-new training program designed to find recruits talented enough to pilot humanity’s first mechs, he can hardly believe it.</p> <p>He’s right to be doubtful.

Worse, the training instructor is an unhinged chief with a particular dislike for Jake.</p> <p>But Jake refuses to give up, refuses to wash out, because humanity is facing its greatest threat yet. If someone doesn’t step up, it could all be over for the human species.</p> <p>Contains the complete series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Powered</i></li> <li><i>Dynamo</i></li> <li><i>Meltdown</i></li> <li><i>Infliction</i></li> </ul>";
