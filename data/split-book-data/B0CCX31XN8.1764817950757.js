You'd be wrong.</p> <p>The shifters are pressing hard to take over the territory they believe belongs to them. Too bad Cait's coven lives there. An assassin that's gunning for her may have a new ally—a second Syndicate assassin. That can't be good.</p> <p>And the Dragons on Oriceran face a threat they can't see, smell, or hear.</p> <p>In the breach stand Cait and Aza, refusing to bend or break as they fight to protect those in their care. Fortunately, they'll have allies. Aisling the technomancer, Sabrina the infomancer, and a new piece of unexpected magic. Will it be enough to keep the scales balanced, at least for a while longer?</p> <p>And there's always the threat of the Rhazdon artifacts, which Cait seems fated to find. The Federal Agents of Magic will need to lend a hand with those pieces of pure evil.</p> <p>The US Marshal with something extra wouldn't have it any other way.</p>";
