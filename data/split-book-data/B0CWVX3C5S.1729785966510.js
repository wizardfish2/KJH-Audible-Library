The answers to these questions may surprise both heroes and villains alike.</p> <p>In the east, Sampson, Grym, and Charlotte seek to unearth the seventh and final godblade. But to do so, they must overcome the wiles of the magical forest of Echoeswood while facing enemies lurking in every shadow.</p> <p>In the west, dragonriders Peony and Dane must unite what is left of the fractured nations of Kingfall, but a surprise visitor has the potential to destroy what small measure of peace the bondmates have managed to restore to Travail.</p> <p>In the north, Rose must come to terms with her own undeadness while facing demons no living human has ever faced.</p> <p>In the south, Ando and his merry band of misfits journey the Loslandian wilderness in search of their purpose, a purpose that destiny always knew would lead them back to Kingfall. But will they arrive in time with their entire crew intact?</p> <p>And all the while, the enemy draws closer, the creatures known as the Thousands drawn by the scent of human blood and the promise of chaos.
