Due to the budget cuts in his company, he had been laid off, losing his job as a project manager and team leader. Just a common occurrence, not like it bothered him.</p> <p>But he certainly didn't expect to get scouted by another company soon after. Through the RPG game he was playing during a free afternoon? Even less.</p> <p>In the span of a few hours, Lucas' perspective of the world was turned upside down. Things that shouldn't be possible were happening right in front of his eyes. Monsters were real. Dungeons were real. People on Earth were constantly in grave danger. His relatives were constantly in grave danger.</p> <p>Pushed forth by that thought, he accepted the offer.</p> <p>Now, as a fresh intern in a very mysterious company, Lucas has to risk his life to fend off the monsters that threaten his homeworld and his close ones while earning riches he couldn't have ever even dreamed of in the past.</p> <p>But he won't be alone. His leadership talent will certainly come in handy when he picks his Class.</p>";
