After untold sacrifice, humanity won—barely. Victory was only possible thanks to the hidden martials revealing themselves and stepping onto the stage of history. They were named the Old Monsters, immortal superhumans with impossible strength and speed, capable of dismantling entire armies with their bare hands.</p> <p>Thus began the gold rush of the 25th century; the rush to fitness, to the unimaginable power displayed by the Old Monsters. Wars were abolished, replaced by duels. Ancient medicines were rediscovered and improved, enhancing lifespans and leading to an unprecedented boom in population across the globe.</p> <p>In this grand new era, a technology was perfected. It was supposed to be the AI’s greatest weapon, and last-ditch attempt to overtake humanity: quantum computing. Twisted by the hands of its creators and enemies, the quantum computers birthed an unexpected advancement that once more shook the foundations of civilization.</p> <p>They called it: Time dilation.</p> <p>Through it, humans tripled their life expectancy. Have a thirty minute lunch break? Turn it into an hour and a half. Only two days of vacation with the family, why not make it six? In mere days, the fundamental human experience was flipped on its head. Of course, a world obsessed with martial prowess would not let such a good thing go unmolested.</p> <p>For ten years, corporations willing to cross any line in the name of profits strangled the world into submission by restricting access to the dilation. They turned countries against each other and assassinated anyone foolish enough to stand in their way, until only they remained in control.</p> <p>Then, they enslaved everyone.</p> <p>Raine KongRu signed a lifelong contract with CronGate and spent his best years as another cog in the corporation's rise to power. He faced death at every turn, and barely came out breathing on the other end.</p> <p>Now, he’s awoken in his old body, two days before it all began. With a chance to amend his mistakes, he'll have his revenge while teaching the world exactly how deadly a man becomes after thirty years of the most brutal martial combat ever imagined.</p> <p><b>What you can expect to find in Martial Messiah:</b></p> <p><b>Tension! ToraAKR’s overarching goal for Martial Messiah was to create a VRMMO that overcame the largest pitfall of its genre: Tension. Listeners beware: this is not a story you can enjoy relaxing comfortably in the back of your seat.</b></p> <p><b>Martial Messiah contains complex LitRPG and magic systems. In this logical living world, every action has rippling consequences that create a deep sense of immersion. Minimal contrived plot armor B.S. And an MC who isn't afraid of the fairer sex or engaging in meaningful relationships.</b></p>";
