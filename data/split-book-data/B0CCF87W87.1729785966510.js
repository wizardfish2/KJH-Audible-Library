window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Four complete books of a time-loop LitRPG fantasy series where a reluctant hero is forced to fight against an impossible catastrophe. </p> <p>On Karell, you are either blessed by the gods, granted a unique power and the ability to gain experience and levels, or you are forgotten. Micah Silver was a boy picked for greatness. Chosen by the gods to bear a mythic power, he longed to take his place among the heroes and legends he grew up reading about.</p> <p>Unfortunately, his primary blessing only allows him to travel into the past by sacrificing his class, wealth, and levelsâ€”a psychological burden that Micah is reluctant to shoulder. But, even if Micah is unwilling, fate has a way of forcing you to face your destiny, and running away can cost you everything.</p> <p>Over and over again....</p> <p>Don't miss this special-edition full-series bundle from Cale Plamann, best-selling author of <i>Viceroy's Pride</i> and <i>Tower of Somnus</i>. Using his talents for enchanting items and summoning creatures, Micah must retrace his steps and grow stronger in a potentially futile effort to prevent tragedy and protect his family.</p>";
