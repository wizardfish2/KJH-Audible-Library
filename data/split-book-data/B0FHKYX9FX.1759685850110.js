But her journey won’t be simple. The Black Rose wants her for an important plan that will happen at her destination. A plan that will endanger those involved, and unbeknownst to her draw the ire of an Archmage—a mage capable of using Level 400 magic. And as if that wasn’t enough trouble, a high-level member of the Arcane Council wants something from her.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the world as a whole is in turmoil. The Republic of Mercenaries has been turned upside down thanks to Oracle’s schemes, and to top it off the Primordial Spirit of the region has been missing, but all of this is not something that directly concerns Amber.</p> <p>At least, not until she finds herself venturing towards the Primordial Spirit tower in the Republic of Mercenaries in need of something important, where great and difficult trials await her. Where once more, she will have no choice but to risk her life for her goals.</p> <p>But Amber will overcome it all, whether it is the troubles in the Sacred Forest, or the status quo of the Republic of Mercenaries; she will come out stronger.</p>";
