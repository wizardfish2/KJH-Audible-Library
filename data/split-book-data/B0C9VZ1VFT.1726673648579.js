window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two things are impossible to walk away from: death and vintage clothing. Trust me. I've tried.</b><br> <br> Moving across the country and opening a costume shop was supposed to be my chance for a normal life. What I wanted was a fresh start, one where the biggest danger would be a carelessly wielded sewing needle.<br> <br> What I ended up with was a trail of dead bodies, a power I didn't ask for, and a host of enemies with ties to my twin sister's decade-old murder. Throw in a stony-eyed enforcer I can't seem to shake and a new goat shifter BFF, and I'm knee deep in trouble. <br> <br> Walking away from this alive is going to require more than my wicked fashion sense. To survive, I'll have to embrace the legacy I've spent most of my life running from.<br> <br> <br> <b>The complete series omnibus includes:</b><br> <i>Fastening the Grave<br> Threading the Bones<br> Stitching the Talisman<br> Gathering the Dead<br> </i><br> </p>";
