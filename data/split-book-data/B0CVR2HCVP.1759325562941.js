Now, I'm going to show them how it's really done.</b></p> <p>Starting over is never easy, but after acquiring the deadly Plague Revenant class, I'm rather looking forward to my new life. Killing people has never been something I was too interested in, but after losing my friends to a darkness-worshipping asshole and his cronies during a bounty hunt, I've put all that aside. Now, I'm going to be the hunter, and they will be the prey.</p> <p>The city of Greystone is a vicious place, one that is unforgiving and opportunistic. I will not forgive, and I will take every opportunity thrown my way to get stronger short of praying to the dark god. Enough lunatics are doing that already...</p> <p>After adopting an alcoholic talking pangolin-badger War Beast from another world with a sharp tongue and keen mind, an interesting opportunity presents itself to hurry along my chance for revenge.</p> <p>After having kept my hands to myself for years, It's time to enjoy myself a bit as well with an enemy-turned-ally magician who is as smart as she is beautiful, a bar owner who can equally hold herself in a fight as much as with liquor, and the only other survivor other than myself, a golden-haired healer who's even more damaged than I am.</p> <p>Change looms behind Greystone's colossal walls as guilds vanish, arena fighters wind up dead, and whispers of a great war permeate the streets. My name is Cade, a man driven by vengeance, and I am going to bring it all down!</p>";
