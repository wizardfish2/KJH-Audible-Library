My assigned classes are nothing like I’d hoped, and I’ve been sent to face monsters with little more than an empty spellbook and a seemingly indestructible frying pan.</p> <p>But it’s not all bad. There’s a gorgeous swashbuckling catgirl and a stunning gun-crazy half-elf who both have my back. We’re going to need to work together more than ever now that all the dungeon exits have been closed off, trapping us underground with hordes of vicious creatures.</p> <p>Which means it’s time to burst out the cooking spray and go to work.</p> <p>Some heroes slay monsters. I sauté them.</p>";
