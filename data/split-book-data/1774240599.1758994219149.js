He'll encounter filthy bandits, musty crypts, and friendly werewolves. Oh, you heard us right.</p> <p>If only he wasn't given negative charisma points around women, he might have a chance, but you can't win them all.</p> <p>When the only way out of the game may be through, you fight like your life depends on it. Because it just may. Survival means victory, and defeat could mean the end - forever.</p> <p>Note from the authors: This one's for the underdogs out there. For lovers of adventure, the dice rollers of chaos, and the unapologetic gamers. We can't promise it'll be safe, but we can promise you're in for one great journey.</p>";
