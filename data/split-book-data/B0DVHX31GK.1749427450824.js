window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The aliens came without warning and humanity quickly found itself waging a losing war.</b></p> <p>My name is James Thorne, and I wasn't supposed to matter. Before the invasion, I was just a guy in a dead-end job, keeping my head down and my past buried. The Gehenna want our annihilation. Thankfully, they angered the Aetherion who may help humanity not only fight back, but turn the tide.</p> <p>When I’m offered the chance to be Cleansed, to become something more than I was, I take it. And it turns out I’m special. No, I’m not the Chosen One. And yes, there are others like me, but as a Psyker, I can do things most can't. Things that make me very dangerous.</p> <p>As the war expands, the Gehenna think they’ve already won.</p> <p>But they underestimated the power of a pissed off marine.</p>";
