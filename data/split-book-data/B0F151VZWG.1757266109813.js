Her dreams of building realms burned in an elvish campaign she was never meant to survive—one that the Dragonsteel Order will fight to keep secret at all costs.</p> <p>But the rules in the Deep North's wilderness are different. Outside the bounds of elvish rule, she may make her own.</p> <p>Elondria faces the beginning of another continental war—with Skálda and Bale at the center. The time has come for the first rider in all history to dare ride a Bael into battle.</p> <p>To protect her dragon and the free peoples of the North from the Order, Skálda will have no choice but to break.
