But it’s not over. His enemy is still out there, nursing a decades-old vendetta, and now his guild is coming after him for breaking their rules. </p> <p>Cade desperately needs credits and somewhere to lie low for a while. To that end, he takes a job on an uncharted world, code-named Nexus, to rescue a team of missing researchers and to recover the alien artifacts that they went searching for. But Nexus proves to be far deadlier than even its class-five hazard rating would suggest, and Cade realizes that he’ll be lucky to escape with his life, let alone accomplish the mission. Yet unknown to Cade, there is a danger on Nexus that goes far beyond the alien monsters that prowl its surface: A terrifying menace has been waiting for untold eons to emerge. </p> <p>And Cade Korbin is just about to wake it up.</p>";
