The term refers to an event that happens when humans leave the city and a horde of monsters gathers to attack them. It’s guaranteed to happen while their sect is being built, which means it is up to Adam, Aris, Fayte, Kureha, Lilith, Susan, and Titania to defend the construction workers while they build it.<br> <br> But how can they defend anything when faced with hundreds of monsters all above level 30?</p>";
