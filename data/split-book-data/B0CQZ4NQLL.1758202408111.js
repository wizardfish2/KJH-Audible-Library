The kids get stuck as a cleric, fire mage, and other stalwarts of your typical fantasy gaming party.</p> <p>Now they must quest through a land of pissed-off warriors, angry giants, a pompous vampire, and a necromancer out to kill Petra and her child.</p> <p>Despite being in a world where everything threatens to shuffle off her mortal coil, the hardest part is convincing a hulked-out man that the battle axe is not a toy, the undead are not cuddly, and he should use the potty.</p>";
