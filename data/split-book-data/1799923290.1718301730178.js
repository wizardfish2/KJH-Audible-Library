She survived life as a slave, survived the Dreamweaver’s touch - but surviving Marshal Kellee and the mysterious Talen is a whole other game, one she’s not sure she’s ready for. When the three are captured by a bloodthirsty fae general sweeping through the last of Halow’s human colonies, the only weapons they have left are lies. </p> <p>And so Kesh must pretend to be the gladiator they all expect, while Kellee is forced to fight against her, and Talen is....Well, just who is Talen when he can command soldiers with a glance and move among the fae elite as though he belongs? Trust doesn’t come easy for Kesh Lasota, and neither does love. She must survive both, or everything she’s fought for will be lost forever, including her men.</p> <p>The enchanting and mind-blowing Messenger series continues with more action, more romance, and more exciting twists!</p> <p>PLEASE NOTE: The Messenger Chronicles is a slow burn reverse harem. The reverse harem elements develop during the series.</p>";
