Take off your coat and get warm by the fire—I have a question for you.</p> <p>Have you ever wondered what happens when the world of magic meets honest craft? Then perhaps you've never met an artificer before. Self-sorting wardrobes, ever-burning candles, front doors that turn away unwanted visitors—whatever you need, an artificer can make it.</p> <p>Does that sound like the job for you? Then venture into Sunhampton, the little town where each morning greets you with a cup of coffee and the promise of a bright day.</p> <p>Nestled there is Lewis's workshop, where he serves the town's artificeric needs. He fixes self-spicing stewpots and he tinkers with clockwork cleaning systems. And every so often, an unusual job comes his way.</p> <p>Can Lewis fix up the old house by the river and make it livable again? And what about the waterwheel at the lumbermill, which mysteriously stopped turning one day, and nobody knows why?</p> <p>No answer is easy, no job is straightforward. But with master crafters to guide him, loyal friends at his side, and his curiosity driving him forward, Lewis will get to the bottom of it.</p>";
