On his way back from Sal's Sandwiches, he came across the hobo that would change his life and the people of earth forever. Exchanging a free coupon for a wishing stone, Cameron inadvertently touched off an earth-changing event that would mean the death of billions. Forty years old and overweight, he must somehow find a way to fight his way through an alien invasion to keep his species from going extinct. </p> <p>Using whatever alien technology he can scavenge, Cameron plans to do just that. He's not alone as other humans rise to the challenge with the aid of other species sympathetic to their cause. The human race will have to run, gun, and survive if it's going to forge a new way forward through Armageddon Earth.</p>";
