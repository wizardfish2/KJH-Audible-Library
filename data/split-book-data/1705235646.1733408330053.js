window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hell hath no fury like a Horseman scorned.</p> <p>They say the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. For Lazarus Kerrigan, that couldn't be further from the truth. He's got no intention of playing nice once he gets there, not with Emma's soul on the line.</p> <p>To free her, he'll have to travel through not one Hell, but seven, cutting deals with ghosts, Titans, and gods who would rather crush the Pale Horseman than help him.</p> <p>Opening that many doors to the underworld is a dangerous plan, one that will require him to call in every favor. It still might not be enough to help him get there in time, since he's got only seven days before death's door slams shut to him forever.</p> <p>Time to raise a little Hell.</p>";
