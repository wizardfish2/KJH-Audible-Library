She’s simple like that—but her life is about to drastically change. Although Liv would rather stay out of the politics and conspiracies that she ran away from years ago, her family needs her. It’s only a twelve-year stint until her sister, the next in line, can take over. So what’s the harm in activating her magic and accepting her place as a warrior?</p> <p>Book Two, The Uncooperative Warrior: The House of Seven keeps sending Liv on wild goose chases, but this warrior has a way of stumbling upon clues. When one leads her to an unlikely ally, Liv strikes up a partnership she might end up regretting.</p> <p>Book Three, The Defiant Magician: Liv isn’t deterred when the council assigns her a case that no one would dare to go near. Even though Clark is worried for her, she won’t back down.</p> <p>Book Four, The Triumphant Daughter: Liv is more motivated than ever to discover where the clues her siblings left behind lead.
