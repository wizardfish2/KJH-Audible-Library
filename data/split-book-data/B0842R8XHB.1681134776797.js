window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) was nearly mankind’s last invention. AI took off like a rocket, then when it racked up an impressive death toll, it crashed before it could blossom and took most high-tech industries with it. Resistance and fears became deep-set.</p> <p>Two decades after the infamous Rev. 4.6 incidents, humanity hasn’t quit dreaming of the wealth and power that could be at their fingertips. A new generation of mega corporations rose from the ashes. When one melds a quantum computer to a barely functional mental patient as a PR move, there are those who seek to profit, those who want to destroy it, and Alex.</p> <p>Alex Sage is a typical college student trying to keep up his grades and, maybe, find a meaningful connection with the fairer sex. Then, an automated semi crashes into his home, killing his family and turning his head into a pincushion in the process.</p> <p>Alex awakens to find most of his memories gone and an illegal AI hidden in his brain implant. Now the pet project of a tech billionaire and heavily in debt, Alex struggles to stay valuable enough to be kept online. Still grappling with the repercussions of his injuries and threats from a dangerous anti-augmentation political movement, there are no easy answers, and threats loom around every corner. Alex must use whatever resources he can to escape from under the thumb of a ruthless corporation, while keeping those he comes to love safe.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> This book embraces cyberpunk ideology in parts. Expect sex, drugs, and anarchy against the establishment. It embraces an antihero protagonist and is not fade to black.</p>";
