window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Most mortals would kill for the chance to live a life at court. To wade into the intrigue of noble life, uphold honor and defend your lineage and kingdom. Nero wasn't a mortal, though, and he'd endured millennia striving to fend of rivals in the vast emptiness of the Abyssal Plain. For the Ninth Prince of Eternis, such was his destiny.</p> <p>That all changed when he stepped through the veil and took on a mortal body. His life in Terranus had been as exciting as he'd hoped, and it wasn't long before he accumulated wealth, earned respect, and married a beautiful wife named Aeris. Yet the adventuring life wore on his partner, and the couple retired to the frontier to live a simple life alongside their lover Cali.</p> <p>Nero tried to be good, tried to avoid conflict and live peaceably. Some are born to sew chaos and create change, however. When exploring a nearby forest, he and his younger sister-in-law Angie discovered an ancient relic. Given a choice to delve into an unknown dungeon, both accepted the challenge and entered.</p> <p>Little did they know, that decision would transform their world. Nero regretted nothing as he took his first steps in reclaiming a dark lord's kingdom.</p>";
