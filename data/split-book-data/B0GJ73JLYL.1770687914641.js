But the providence system had one last twist in store; it sent me to school?! A new god school in a realm crawling with ruthless deities, scheming clans, and archaic social norms.</p> <p>Despite the challenges, my mission remains clear—help Pandora and Eve reach apotheosis, gain the strength I’ll need to roam the realms freely, and finally appreciate what it means to truly live. To do this, I’ll have to master my godhood, make powerful allies, and survive the treacherous world of divine clan politics, all while staying true to myself and protecting those I care about.</p> <p>Join me on a journey where divinity reveals itself to be far less divine—and far more dangerous—than I ever believed.</p>";
