With the help of his family and others, Dom defeats the demonesses and allies they brought. After some interrogation, Dom finds out who is responsible. But even knowing that the noble is responsible, he realizes that something big is happening on Risona. Even though he doesn't want to be involved, Dom gets dragged in.
