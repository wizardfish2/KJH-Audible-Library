window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I thought I was destined for an early grave. Apparently, fate had other plans for me.</p> <p>My name is Jake. After twenty-three years of life, all I have to my name is a dead-end job and an undiagnosed metabolic disorder that has the doctors baffled.</p> <p>Everything changed on my birthday when I found a magical key that followed me home. It led me to the Halls of Magic, a multiversal repository of arcane knowledge that will allow me the chance to cure my broken body and unlock arcane power.</p> <p>However, the Halls are long abandoned and overrun with man-eating monsters. Also, my Spellbook looks like it's straight out of a video game. When I turned to the Aspects of Magic for help, they broke free of their crystalline prisons and then moved in with me back on Earth. To say they have a lot to learn about being human is an understatement.</p> <p>Welcome to the Halls of Magic. You never know just what you'll learn.</p>";
