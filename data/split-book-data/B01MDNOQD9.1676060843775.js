The bad news is he's the new Pablo Escobar, a primal being, and all but untouchable. </p> <p>It gets worse. He's rounding up the Russian mob for something big, and I'm not the only spellslinger in the picture. They say follow the money or follow the drugs. Maybe I should keep an eye on who's following me. </p> <p>Some problems call for a delicate hand. I don't have those kinds of problems. </p>";
