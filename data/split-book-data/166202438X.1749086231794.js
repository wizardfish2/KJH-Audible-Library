The clues we find take us halfway across the world and, to my irritation, leave us depending on two men.</p> <p>One, a werewolf who has his own set of secrets. And the other, a Cazador like Lea...only this one is human and more tempting than I’d like to admit.</p> <p>The only way to win this new fight will be to trust one another.
