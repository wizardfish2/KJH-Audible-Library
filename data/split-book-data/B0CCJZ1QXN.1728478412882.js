window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A quiet retirement as the Dean of a Magical Academy. As if!</p> <p>Dominic tore through the lands to raise his magical might as well as his prestige. He reached the pinnacle of the realm, becoming an SS Ranked Sorcerer, and yet, it never gave him the fulfillment he desired. A lost love and a fractured party of adventurers through constant battles sent his purpose adrift.</p> <p>His wayward journey encountered a point of tedium, and so, when the King asked him to take the helm of Herexei Academy, he humbly accepted. The thing is, there are a lot of problems when you're the Dean. Young students are rash, constantly thinking they know better than the rules bestowed upon them, instructors are underpaid, overworked, prone to adult problems most find trivial, and then there are the unknowns that always seem to arise at the worst possible times.</p> <p>Nothing is mundane at a magical academy for the gifted, even if Dean Hawthorne wishes it were.</p> <p>Join Dominic as he welcomes a new batch of first-year students while counting down the days to his retirement. And if he's lucky, the mysterious issues that are creeping into the hallowed halls of Herexei will just go away on their own volition...</p>";
