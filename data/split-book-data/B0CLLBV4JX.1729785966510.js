They live among the human realms, waiting for their moment to strike.</p> <p>Prince Gray, heir to the throne, has discovered these shapeshifters. Stopping this hidden force will require alliances with creatures beyond the edge of civilization: a secluded tribe of beastkin women.</p> <p>The all-female tribe exists on the edge between human and animal. They are powerful, but they are nothing compared to the threat of the shapeshifters. They need someone to protect them, someone who can unlock their potential, someone who has the ability to transform them into so much more. Someone like Gray: a man with the ability to bond to the beastkin. In exchange for protection, he'll receive power.</p> <p>Together with these alluring non-humans, Gray seeks the truth behind the monsters and the origin of the strange powers he wields.</p>";
