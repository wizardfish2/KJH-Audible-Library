Now, the World is on Notice!</p> <p>**Please note, as mentioned in another review, there is flagrantly foul language in this novel. The main character does not have a problem with cussing, just uninspired cussing.</p> <p>If you haven't listened to the previous books, you will need to go back to #1 (the book does not explain the characters and previous relationships/deeds).</p>";
