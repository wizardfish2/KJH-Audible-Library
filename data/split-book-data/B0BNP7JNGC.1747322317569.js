While it was treacherous in the cold, northern region where she called home, the new region is unlike anything she has ever encountered before.</p> <p>The darkness-shrouded Nightgloom Swamp is not for the faint of heart.</p> <p>Full of large pools of stagnant water where powerful, unknown creatures prey on those trying to cross over their domain, as well as narrow land bridges that connect different islands located inside the Swamp, the real danger comes from the dungeons that reside nearby. Out of those dungeons roam the undead in numerous hordes, and only those versed in the ways of the formerly living can successfully navigate their way through it without falling victim to the dangers lurking around every dark corner.</p> <p>Will Tempara be able to brave this new and unknown region, or will she be frightened by the undead hordes waiting to pounce on some fresh meat?</p> <p><i>This story contains Dungeon Core elements such as dungeon construction and defense, LitRPG/GameLit mechanics such as character progression and stats, and </i><b><i>does not </i></b><i>contain harems/sexual content or profanity.</i></p>";
