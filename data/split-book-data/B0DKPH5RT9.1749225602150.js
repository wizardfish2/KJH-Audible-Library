window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What would you do if you were given a second chance?</b></p> <p>Titus Briggs is an Earth Defense soldier, a grunt, a decorated war hero—it's all he's ever known. So when a career-ending injury leaves him lying in a hospital bed, missing both legs, he struggles to accept his new reality. He can no longer walk, which means he can no longer fight.</p> <p>That is until a mysterious colonel arrives and offers Titus the opportunity to step into a new kind of war, a new kind of fight. To become a new kind of soldier.</p> <p>Mobile Combat Suits—MOCOMS—represent the next stage in human warfare. They enable soldiers to fight like never before. Stronger. Faster. Bristling with weaponry. Far more lethal.</p> <p>Even a disabled veteran like Titus can operate one… if he can find the heart, grit, and determination needed to pass selection.</p> <p>Now, with the end of humanity upon him, Titus must become the <i>Able Bodied Soldier.</i></p>";
