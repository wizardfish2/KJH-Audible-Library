window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Isekaied into an ice world? Could be worse... Right?</p> <p>Yeah, apparently it can be a whole lot worse....</p> <p>When Jay Morgan and his bestie, Molly O'Brian, take \"wrong turn\" to a whole new level, they end up sucked into a world that makes the arctic look like a beach vacation.</p> <p>Even worse? After a bump on the head during their trip through the portal, Molly's taking an unplanned nap of potentially eternal proportions, and Jay has no choice but to carry her through a frosty wilderness that gets weirder by the mile.</p> <p>Enter the Delvers: half-animal, half-nutjob nomads who tell Jay he can save Mollyâ€”if he's willing to brave the infamously cursed Ice Dungeon for a legendary item that is rumored to be able to heal portal-related injuries.</p> <p>No biggie, except Jay's about as prepared for dungeon diving as a penguin is for a desert marathon. No party, no class, no relevant skills... He's pretty much f*&amp;$ed. If Jay wants Molly to survive, though, he has no choice but to try.</p> <p>So when an arctic fox-girl named Lyra appears, offering Jay a crash course in survival, of course he agrees.</p> <p>Turns out Lyra is an Arcane Archer with more quirks than arrows. There might be a reason she hasn't got a diving party of her own. Why are the cute ones always crazy?</p> <p>Crazy or not, though, the silver fox-girl is Jay's best shot at saving Molly.</p> <p>When you're battling frost monsters and your ally might be nuts, you either laugh or you cry. And Jay's not much of a crier. Can he save Molly and keep his sanity intact? With Lyra's \"help,\" it's going to be a close call.</p>";
