This old soul has lost&nbsp;everything - and more.</p> <p>In a world of gods and demons, there is no room for a weak newborn dungeon. Now with a new name, Smit and his creations will have to carve out their own place. The path may be long and dangerous, but with a soul hardier than stone and a will stronger than iron, will he be able to forge his own destiny?</p> <p>“Debut author&nbsp;David Sanchez-Ponton knocks it out of the park with a brand-new Dungeon Core Novel that is sure to be up there with the likes of Divine Dungeon, Rogue Dungeon, and Bone Dungeon.
