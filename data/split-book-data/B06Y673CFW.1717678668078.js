The age of Virtual Reality came long ago, opening up new fields for people to enjoy and seek employment.

The first consoles, known as Seeds, are mass distributed among the people, with such realism that they no longer qualified as a Virtual Reality, but as an Artificial Reality. But what happens when things become too real? </p>";
