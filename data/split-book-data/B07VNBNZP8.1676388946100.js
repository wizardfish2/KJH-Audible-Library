But even the best-laid plans go awry, and after escaping a sentient dungeon and defeating a would-be world conqueror, Gryph is no closer to finding Brynn.</p> <p>Then, while mourning the tragic death of a friend and grappling with the burdens of leadership, an ally, thought long dead, returns offering the slimmest of hopes.</p> <p>This hope takes Gryph and his friends on a journey through strange lands where they must outwit a mystical crime syndicate, evade an infallible bounty hunter and face-off against Brynn herself, now a goddess with no memory of her true self.</p> <p>Gryph must triumph over them all. If he fails, both he and his sister will not only lose their lives, they will lose their souls.</p> <p><b>Warning:</b> Welcome to your new favorite genre.&nbsp;</p> <p>LitRPG/GameLit is genre that incorporates gaming elements from tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder with epic RPG video games like The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim and MMO’s like World of Warcraft and sets them in a fantasy or science fiction setting.
