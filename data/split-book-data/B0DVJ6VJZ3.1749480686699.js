window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As a C-Tier Lifeblade, Ethan keeps his head down, works hard, and always hits his mark. His skills might not be flashy, but they get the job done—and in SlayerCorp's cutthroat portal acquisitions industry, reliability makes you valuable. He’s built a solid rep as the go-to healer who can hold his own in any situation, with a resume that's earned him the respect and admiration of his peers. But Ethan's biggest challenge isn’t in the dungeons he clears or the creatures he fights.</p> <p>It’s <b>Lily Chen.</b></p> <p>His cute neighbor and coworker is an A-Tier Berserker. Powerful, beautiful, untouchable—and living right next door. For months, Ethan’s been drowning in daydreams, but he knows better than to reach. The Tier gap between them, favoring her, makes the prospect of dating her seem next to impossible. So Ethan keeps his distance, telling himself she’s a dream that’ll never be his. What he doesn’t know?</p> <p>Lily’s worshiped him for years.</p> <p>She doesn’t care about Tier gaps. She doesn't care about what others think. All she wants in this world is Ethan.</p> <p>But when a routine dungeon run goes sideways, Ethan and Lily find themselves permanently connected... for better or worse.</p> <p>If Ethan can’t figure out how to navigate this twisted new reality and make do with the cards he's been dealt, the monsters waiting on the other side of the portal will be the least of his worries.</p> <p>The real fight? Surviving the girl next door.</p>";
