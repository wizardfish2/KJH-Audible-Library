But then again, I supposed I was thankful to just have another day to begin with, considering I’d apparently been a mindless monster for the last several months.</p> <p>The city was a mess, with many buildings destroyed by massive black towers that rose into the sky like enormous thorns. And yet, despite all this, I was about to discover that the monsters and bizarre landscape weren’t the strangest things about the apocalypse.</p> <p>At least, not if the visual hallucination that displayed game-like stats counted.</p> <p>Prologue</p> <p>As she got into position to strike, I quickly realized that stalking must truly come naturally to our kind, because the little demon proceeded to expertly sneak up on the man like a ninja, leaping onto his back and sinking her teeth into his neck.</p> <p>I could hear the snap from here, as she broke his spine at the base of his skull, dropping him to the ground in an instant. However, the fact that I could hear it so loudly also meant that the other man did too.</p> <p>He whipped his head around, just in time to see a four-legged creature dash behind another car.</p> <p>Crying out in shock, he fired his gun a few shots after she had already vanished, only to run over to his partner in crime, continuing to point his weapon towards the car.</p> <p>Little did he realize that she was already on the move the moment he glanced away.</p> <p><b><i>Rise of the Deathstalkers</i></b><b> is a full-length novel.</b></p> <p><b>Genres: LitRPG / gamelit, post-apocalyptic, adventure fantasy</b></p>";
