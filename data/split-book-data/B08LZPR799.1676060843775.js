window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It started with a revolution nobody had even realized occurred....</p> <p>Its cruelty sparked a rebellion that everyone refused to admit existed....</p> <p>Now, the Machine - a terrifying and relentless enemy - reigns supreme in the galaxy, and the real fight is just beginning.&nbsp;</p> <p>Omega Force keenly feels the weight of responsibility for the Machine's arrival in the quadrant, but even with the resources of the Blazing Sun organized crime syndicate backing them, there's only so much the small mercenary crew can do against the malevolent AI that has already usurped control of most of the government.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the Machine now firmly in control of the ConFed's military, they are out of time and out of options. Captain Jason Burke knows that along with the Machine, something else came back from the outer regions...something he's kept a secret from everybody, even his own crew. He knows that he likely has the power to stop the Machine in its tracks, but it means unleashing an equally uncontrollable force. As he struggles to know what the right thing to do is, he can't help but fear that the cure could very well be worse than the disease.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Pandora Paradox</i> is the 12th installment of the best-selling Omega Force series.</p>";
