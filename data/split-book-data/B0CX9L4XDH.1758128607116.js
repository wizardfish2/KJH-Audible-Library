Ambitious town-building projects are set to reshape the country’s cities into defendable fortresses.</p> <p>When the inevitable attack arrives, Ruwen's decision to spring an obvious trap in order to save a friend leads to catastrophic consequences, threatening his friends, his allies, and potentially hurtling the universe toward ultimate destruction.</p> <p>\"The Ninth Harbinger\" follows Ruwen, a Divine Apostasy, in his relentless pursuit of balance in a universe teetering on the brink of annihilation.</p>";
