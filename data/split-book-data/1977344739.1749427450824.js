Now, to keep from turning into a ghoul himself, he has no choice but to wait in Faerie while his friends work on a cure. Lucky for Laz, he's got friends in high places inside the Summer Court. </p> <p>Laz is barely settled in when he's caught up in an assassination plot against the Summer Princess, who just happens to be his ex-girlfriend. With the Summer Knight injured, who better to step in and take his place protecting the royal family than Lazarus himself? </p> <p>In a land with no death, however, the Pale Horseman finds himself at an extreme disadvantage. With his powers limited, and the clock ticking as the ghoul virus ravages his body, Laz had better find the assassins and cure himself fast, or he's dead meat.</p>";
