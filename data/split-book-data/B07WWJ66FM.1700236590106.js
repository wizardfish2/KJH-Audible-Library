window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Riella Akema is a Pantherian, the rare child of a human and Therian. In her case, her father was an Elderfel, a cat-like humanoid that despises all other races, making her an abomination in their eyes.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The only reason she’s still alive is because her mother sacrificed everything to buy her 18 years of safety in the magically protected forest of the elves.&nbsp;</p> <p>But now that time has come to an end.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her birthday present from the elves is her permanent exile. Riella must now face the outside world for the first time, along with the dangers and discrimination that come with it. However, unknown to her, the Elderfel have been waiting all this time for her to reappear. Her life means more to them than a simple mixing of the races. She is more than just an abomination.&nbsp;</p> <p>Will her magic be enough to defend herself? Or will the Elderfel take her life and steal her soul along with it?</p> <p><b>Prologue</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Really, I felt like I hadn’t truly been living until now. And I wasn’t about to go back to a life of solitude just to keep this body breathing, while my heart slowly withered away in loneliness. I needed to feel, to be alive, even if it did ultimately lead to an early death.&nbsp;</p> <p>I looked up at him with renewed determination, only to realize he wasn’t focused on me anymore, and his expression had changed drastically. He had a look in his eyes that I hadn’t seen before, and I hoped to never see it directed at me.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pure hatred.</p> <p>I turned around, almost expecting him to be looking at the elf, only to see that all three of them were facing the other way too, swords halfway drawn. I gazed further on, trying to understand what was happening, finally seeing it for myself.&nbsp;</p>";
