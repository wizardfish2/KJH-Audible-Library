window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains volumes 4–6 of the epic series.</b></p> <p><b>Beat the Demon Lord and save the world? No, thanks!</b></p> <p>My name is Mal, and ever since I was a boy I've been treated as a malcontent because of my ability to see magic. For everyone else, magic is proof of the Goddess's love. To me, it is just a colorful spread of enchantments, cantrips, blessings, and hexes. And any spell I can see, I can break.</p> <p>I had always expected to grow up to be a ditch-digger. Instead, I was dubbed a hero. Heroes are sent out in the wasteland, to slay monsters and to challenge the Demon Lord. It's a suicide mission. But once I was exiled, I found that the outside world was drastically different than I had thought. The beautiful women I meet, demons, dragons, and orcs, might be my best shot at surviving the insanity I've been thrown into.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
