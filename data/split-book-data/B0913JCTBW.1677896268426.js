Keeping the Spider Queen in check and handling water provisions was never what Abby wanted to do with her life, but it’s what the war demands of her.</p> <p>To add to that never-ending list of demands, suddenly Naitee Mungal has need of Abby as well, and unfortunately, Abby already promised she would answer if Naitee called. Now Abby will have to go where no Traveler has ever been allowed before, face a series of grueling trials, and battle the gods themselves, risking everything to return balance and save her magical brethren.</p> <p>If she fails, the realm of Gaia could once again be overrun by the power of the elements. If she succeeds, she'll become the greatest Firebrand in all of Eldgard.</p> <p><b>From James A.
