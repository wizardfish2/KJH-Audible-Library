window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>She's the most beautiful woman he's ever met. She's also his archnemesis.</b></p> <p>It would be an understatement to call Trevon Beaumont an accomplished monster slayer. He's traversed the European countryside upholding the legacy of his clan one completed mission at a time for the whole of his adult life. Now he's on his most perilous quest yet: slay the cruel but beautiful Countess Dracula.</p> <p>Just as the two of them seem ready to conclude their final battle, however, an unexpected act of betrayal sends them hurtling together through time—bloodbonding them, thus entwining their fates. Reappearing in the twenty-first century, they must get jobs and find a place to stay while they decide how best to proceed now that they are unable to continue their battle to the death.</p> <p>But when Dracula rapidly develops a romantic obsession for Trevon, things get complicated. Even worse, Trevon's forced proximity to the queen of all creatures of the night means that his own self-control is constantly tested. What will become of their budding relationship? Will it be hot?</p> <p><b>Headpats After Dark is a wholesome yandere romantic comedy written for men who enjoy the trope of obsessive women with a few screws loose. This is a work of fiction. If your significant other acts like Dracula does in this novel, those are red flags, people. Take heed.</b></p>";
