window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When the Alpha Event struck Earth, the rules of reality itself were rewritten. Millions died as the world was transformed into a lethal realm of magic and monsters. </b></p> <p>Yet somehow, an overweight, out-of-shape construction supervisor managed not just to survive the apocalypse, but inadvertently became an reluctant hero after saving thousands from one of the many monsters spawned by the mana storm.</p> <p>Now, Adrian Fitzgerald is slimmed down, leveled-up, and ready for the dangerous journey back home to his wife and kids. But the Interface he's spliced with has other plans. Creatures even deadlier than the Bird are almost certainly threatening survivors on the road to Melbourne, and as Adrian learns more about the rules and systems that govern this new reality, he's called to a duty greater than just his own survival.</p> <p>Thousands of souls are counting on his newly-acquired strengths and skills, and the Interface is challenging Adrian to choose between his own desires and continuing along the path towards a destiny he'd never realized he'd been capable of.</p> <p>Which will he choose?</p> <p><i>Delay</i> is the second book in Alex Kozlowski's thrilling <i>Alpha Physics</i> series, a powerful post-apocalyptic litRPG saga.</p>";
