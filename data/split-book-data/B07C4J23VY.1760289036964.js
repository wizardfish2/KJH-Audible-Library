In Coldi society, you can get killed for looking a superior in the eye. Never mind accusing him of murder. </p> <p>1A: <i>The Sahara Conspiracy</i> - Cory is asked to deal with the alien mafia on Earth, and stumbles across a plot that endangers Earth's fragile peace. You did not hear me say \"nuke from orbit\". </p> <p>2: <i>Raising Hell</i> - The wormhole network goes down, and Cory's friend and leader of the largest populated world Asto is caught off-world. Dangerous politics are afoot on Asto, and Cory decides to help his friend. Yeah. Famous last words. </p> <p>This series will appeal to readers who like alien societies that are familiar and disturbingly different at the same time, dangerous political intrigue, edge-of-seat action and characters who are never entirely good or entirely bad. </p> <p>Once you start reading, you won't be able to stop. There are eight books in the series, with more on the way. </p> <p>Why not try this one now? </p>";
