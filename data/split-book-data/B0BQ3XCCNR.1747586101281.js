What should we do next?</p> <p>In short, we must make the city safe and find our path forward. The mistresses and elders have a plan, but it requires us to venture forth into the wilderness and seek out a new mind stone. The problem? We’re just students. And the world beyond Sklava’s wall is a wild and dangerous place.</p> <p>We've found far more than we bargained for—hostile beast tribes, ancient and unpredictable elementals, but also the repercussions of generations full of bad decisions.</p> <p>How will we survive? We must cultivate new strength, find new, more powerful allies, and prepare for a life unlike anything we’ve ever known.</p>";
