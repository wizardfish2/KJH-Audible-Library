Long gone are the days when terms like \"First-Year\" or \"Fourth-Year\" meant something. Now, only skill and Ki mastery matter as our heroes take their next steps on the Path of Ascension. Cultivation and combat application will become all encompassing as the world's best battle academies transform their top students into frontline soldiers.</p> <p><i>Wyvern Academy is a harem cultivation series inspired by Japanese Light Novels as well as a deep love and respect for anime, kung fu, martial arts, and battle academy adventures. It contains some explicit adult content, unconventional relationships, and violence.</i></p>";
