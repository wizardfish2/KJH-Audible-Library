Gated-humanity thrives within their ever-renewing cities in this hostile world. Mages and Archons devote their long lives to give their people a chance.</p> <p>Through tribulation and hardship, Tala has managed to return to the human lands, her freedom hard won, her self intact. Her family and friends await her, but her time away has left its mark. She has to face new trials—face the new weight that she carries—and somehow find a way though things that she has never faced before. While that isn’t exactly new, she is now no longer alone.</p> <p>Supported once again by those who care for her, she is given the tools and help that she needs to deal with the continued threats on her life and her very soul. Her magic and power have grown, but she is not content to let them stagnate.</p> <p>She carries with her the spoils and burdens from the arcane lands, and she is determined to turn them all toward her benefit and the benefit of those to whom she fought so hard to return.</p>";
