Magic is back, my new roommate is a blob of yellow snot, and my friend Sally has been entombed alive in solid rock. Oh, and I’m dead again, or undead anyway.<br> <br> Life’s not quite finished taking a dump on me yet, because now something is hunting vampires in New York City. A smarmy-ass wizard has been called in to investigate – one who’s got a closet full of skeletons and eyes for my girlfriend. To make matters worse, neolithic horrors not seen since the dawn of time have started reappearing to wreak havoc, and all signs point to it somehow being my fault.<br> <br> I’ll need to rally my friends, both new and old, if I’m to have any chance of turning the tide threatening to drown this city in chaos. It won’t be easy, though. The balance of power in the supernatural world has been upended, and it’s going to take a lot more than some attitude and a twitchy middle finger to fix it again.<br> <br> ----------<br> <br> Prepare for pulse-pounding action and laughter in this thrilling vampire comedy series.
