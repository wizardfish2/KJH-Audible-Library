Once, he was a great champion and general in the demonic empire that ruled the world. Now, he’s been erased from history.</p> <p>He’ll need to remind the world of the price of forgetfulness.</p> <p>Now is the time to build his own empire, as the ancient powers of his time are long gone. Rys has an archipelago to conquer, women interested in extending their bloodline with him, and a mysterious labyrinth that holds the secret to why he was sealed away to begin with.</p> <p>But a contract with Hell is eternal. His old employers want to turn him into their pawn, and Rys must become powerful enough to remain free.</p> <p>That’s not a short to-do list. But half the fun of taking over the world is the challenge.</p>";
