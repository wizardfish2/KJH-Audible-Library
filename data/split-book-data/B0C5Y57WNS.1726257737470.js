window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Pray to Eden, slay for Eden, may the foes of humanity bow before her might!<br> <br> In the distant future, humanity wages war on many fronts. In the core systems resides a deity for all to follow—Eden. The youthful monarch is symbolic, serving annual terms to keep humanity blessed under her salvation.<br> <br> For the billions of soldiers within her realm, there is only war to beat back the enemies who try to exploit any weakness they find. Insert Gee, a commander of a forgotten age, cursed with a rebirth of blood and battle.<br> <br> Upon an awakening, he learns Eden's foes encroach, lighting a torch of vindication within his heart. Without hesitation or mercy, he cleanses the filth one ship, one battle, one armada at a time.</p> <p>Eden's Son has returned to the field of battle, and none shall be spared!</p>";
