Then it happened...</b></p> <p>A Secret Service operative and dedicated survivalist, Special Agent Del Roosevelt had a plan for every world-ending scenario and regularly trained for them all.</p> <p>He was even ready for a date with the hottest woman in his office next Friday. At least he hoped so.</p> <p>But all that training, all those rations, all that prepping? Useless for the apocalypse that actually played out. Del wakes up half-buried in a giant trash pile, missing his thumbs. And, um, covered in red fur.</p> <p>He's stuck in a world of fuzzy monsters, senseless violence, and cult-like crusaders. Instead of falling back on known strategy, or making smart decisions based on, I don't know, logic, Del kind of just freaks out. Big time.</p> <p>He knows he's got to get to the top of the tower he's in to find the wizard who presumably turned him into a living toy. Will the help of an academic rat and an exiled little dinosaur get him there? Doubtful.</p> <p>But in all his failing, in all his traipsing around as a silly little red doll, Del starts to realize how ridiculous his life as a prepper actually was. After all, what's the point in surviving if you have no one to live for?</p> <p>Master of Puppets<i> is the first book in an all-new LitRPG adventure by Eric Ugland, bestselling author of The Good Guys series.
