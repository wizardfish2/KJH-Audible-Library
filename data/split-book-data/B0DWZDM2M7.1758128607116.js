Though he lost his parents, he was taken in by a kindly villager who taught him his life's calling: beekeeping. But one day the local lord's ruthless son, Ruckanos, comes to their humble village to claim his own tower, slaughtering everyone.</p> <p>Luckily for Belissar, as he lies dying with an arrow in his back, a tiny worker bee decides to interfere, and he wakes up not only alive but a whole new bee-ing. Turns out his little savior is in actuality a core, and together they've swiped the tower out from under the murderous Ruckanos.</p> <p>Now Belissar is king of his own beehive/dungeon. But with power comes more trouble than he could've imagined. In addition to building and protecting his own monstrous apiary with the help of his fellow bees, he must confront the encroaching doom known as the Hunger that haunts the world and consumes everything in its path, leaving only death.</p> <p>A stronger, smarter, more confident, and <i>far</i> less peaceable Belissar is about to show his enemies that when you mess with a hive, you'd better be ready to get stung.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than four million views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
