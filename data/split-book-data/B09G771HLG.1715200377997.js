window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When dungeon delvers and dinosaurs clash, who can survive?</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Newborn Dungeon Cores must choose what entity they help contain, and that choice determines what monsters they are able to summon. After being executed for crimes forgotten in death, Tira is given the chance to make that choice. Tira chose Acekorah, the Primeval Terror, a being so dangerous few cores will risk trying to contain it.&nbsp;</p> <p>The danger wasn’t important. Tira remembers dying. If containing Acekorah means Tira will face greater danger, that’s a risk worth taking, because the Primeval Terror walked the world long before the races of Man roamed the earth, and Cores bound to him are able to summon beings from beyond the veil of time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, forged in the fires of Tira's wrath, the dinosaurs will walk the world anew.</p>";
