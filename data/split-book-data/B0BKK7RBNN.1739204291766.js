window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Light of the Aegis</i> is the fifth book in a series that tells the tale of Nameless and his bond-mates as they make a new life for themselves in the city of Garland, but they can’t forget what brought them there: The final showdown is coming and once it arrives things will never be the same.</p> <p>Warning: This is a work of erotic fantasy. There is nudity, some swearing, a fair bit of violence, and plenty of naughty sex between men (and women) and monster girl/girls. If that isn’t your cup of tea please give this book a pass!</p> <p>Otherwise please enjoy!</p>";
