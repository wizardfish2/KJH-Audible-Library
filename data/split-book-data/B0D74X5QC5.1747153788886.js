window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ryn Xaven is now free to travel the realm...if he can protect it.</p> <p>Having graduated and bonded three loyal and beautiful mages to his side, Ryn is now officially a primal conjurer: the most powerful mage in the realm. Even so, his first official mission is no easy task. Armed with knowledge gleaned from a dark future, he must stop a second devil war before it starts.</p> <p>Fortunately Nephale, a beautiful blade mage from a dark time, knows where the traitors hide. When she guides Ryn to an innocent who will one day become a devil forgemaster, he knows he must stop this young mage from making a devil deal... but can he kill them for a crime they have yet to commit?</p> <p>Every victory Ryn wins makes Nephale’s dark future more nebulous. Yet with the help of his loyal Saphielle, brave Lauralena, and brilliant Aurienda, Ryn will never fight his battles alone. And with the love and support of his auxiliaries, he will carve his own path toward saving his realm.</p>";
