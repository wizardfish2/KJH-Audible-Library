window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He didn't go to veterinary school for this.</p> <p>Joel Barker is a small town vet and licensed pet groomer, and he used to own his own pet supply store. He's a bit of a renaissance man like that. He's always been good with cats and dogs and things like that, but imagine his reaction when a pale little girl with a pair of suspiciously sharp fangs visits his shop with her big brother, the Grim Reaper. The pet they ask him to help? A three-headed fire-breathing dog from the line of Cerberus.</p> <p>At times like these, Joel isn't sure why he ever moved to Wapa Lake, but things start to get interesting when he's left alone with the pooch. As it turns out, this beast is smarter than it looks...well, two out of three heads anyway. The second surprise came shortly after that, and this one's a doozy: the monstrous hellhound shapeshifts into three beautiful, identical women who seem oddly infatuated with him. Being a vet, he never thought he'd have a romantic relationship with a patient....</p> <p>He'd better hope her bark is worse than her bite.</p>";
