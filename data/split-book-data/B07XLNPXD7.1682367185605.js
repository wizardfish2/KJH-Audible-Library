Unless he learns sacred arts the right way, from scratch, he won’t have a chance to win...and even then, the odds are against him.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the course of their training, he and Yerin travel to the Blackflame Empire, where they fight to master an ancient power left behind by a fallen clan. This is Lindon’s chance to learn a true Path, but there are those who do not wish to see these lost techniques revived.&nbsp;</p> <p>Success means a chance at life, but failure means death.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the sacred arts, those who risk the most travel the farthest.&nbsp;</p>";
