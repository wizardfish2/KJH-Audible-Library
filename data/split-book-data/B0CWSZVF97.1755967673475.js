Now, I have a few extra credits and all the free time in the galaxy, so it’s time to ditch this barren colony and take a well-earned vacation.</p> <p>One small problem—a gorgeous redheaded thief slips aboard my ship, and her cutting-edge cargo is worth millions, if not billions, to the people who want to get it back.
