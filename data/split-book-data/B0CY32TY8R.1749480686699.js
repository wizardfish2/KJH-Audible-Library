window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An oathbreaker paladin. An angel with a dark secret. An unexpected partnership to restore a shattered world.</p> <p>Centuries ago, a cabal of powerful mages cast a disastrous spell that corrupted the source of magic, transforming much of the world's population into merciless monsters called Riven. Empires crumbled. Civilization collapsed.</p> <p>Yet an ember of hope remains. Duncan Keene is a Dread Knight, a dark warrior empowered by an unholy pact with a demon lord. He has sacrificed everything to save the world from the Rivenâ€”his family, his future, even his very soul. When he finds himself unexpectedly partnered with the last uncorrupted angel in the world, she makes it her mission to redeem him.</p>";
