With nothing more than a glance at a photograph, she can judge the living from the dead and the good souls from the evil ones. For 27 years she's kept her ability a secret, but 11 young women have been murdered in the mountains of North Carolina, and Sloan may be the only hope of finding their killer. She has just agreed to help Detective Nathan McNamara with the case when a stranger - who is as alluring as he is terrifying - shows up at her doorstep with a dark past and another puzzling mystery: She can't see his soul at all. Now Sloan is on the hunt for a deadly psychopath with two irresistible men. One of them would die for her, and the other would kill to keep her safe. </p>";
