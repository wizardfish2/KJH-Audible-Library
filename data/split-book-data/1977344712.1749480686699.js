The hours are long, the pay is crap, and every god or monster you meet wants to kill you. </p> <p>For Lazarus Kerrigan, professional necromancer, even helping the police search for some missing internal organs is a welcome relief. That is, until his ex-girlfriend shows up in the employ of an ancient Egyptian deity, and a faerie queen makes him an offer he can't refuse. </p> <p>When Laz finds himself pulled into a criminal underworld where human souls are traded like currency, things just go from bad to worse. Unfortunately, his soul might just be worth its weight in gold.</p>";
