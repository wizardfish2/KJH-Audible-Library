I’ve even cow-tipped the Minotaur. I understand the theory of following the rules...I’m just not very good at the application.</p> <p>Because rules were meant to be broken, and St. Louis has a bit of a supernatural infestation these days. Someone should probably be keeping an eye on these things -and probably an eye on me, too. Before I blow up another building...or three.</p>";
