On my very first day in this world, I was given the title of a count along with all the trimmings: a castle, name, lands and power.</p> <p>You'd think I had it made, but no . . . They seized my castle, took my lands, and now, I'm surrounded by enemies. Moreover, it's nothing but one headache after another with the authorities.</p> <p>And even though I wrested my castle back, the neighbors aren't going anywhere, and they live and breathe to tear off chunks of my land, and eliminate me, the new head of the family.</p> <p>There's just one thing I don't get. Why do they think that since I'm a healer I can't simply raze their house to the ground? Really, don't they see that fine blaze over there? Something's on fire!</p> <p>Well, I'll show them . . .</p>";
