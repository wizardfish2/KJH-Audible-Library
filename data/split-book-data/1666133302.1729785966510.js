It beats sitting in a factory cubical all day, which is where magiteks usually work.</p> <p>Most of humanity hates the magic users who rule the world, but the Magi stand between humans and the creatures who came across the Rift. For a hundred years, the Magi have kept the demons, vampires, and other monsters in check. But now one Magi family has allied itself with the demons in a bid for world domination. It was ugly before, but now it's getting worse.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
