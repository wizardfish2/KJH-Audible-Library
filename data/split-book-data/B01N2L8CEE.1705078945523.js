window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They hunt us. They bomb our worlds for target practice. </p> <p>A star cluster in the constellation of Orion rotates once every 1,000 years. Those who rule there have an ancient tradition: When each cycle ends, they train their fleets by spilling the blood of lesser beings. </p> <p>The enemy fleets are coming again. In response, the Rebel Worlds gather their starships to face the terrifying threat, and this time humanity is asked to stand with them. </p> <p>The last time they considered Earth, Vikings in longboats were raiding English coastlines. Today, we're less primitive. Today, we're a target. </p> <p>One man is chosen to command Earth's single ship in the Rebel Fleet. When the war breaks out, Leo Blake must win it...or die trying. </p> <p>\"Classic B. V. Larson. This book grabs you by the plasma cannon and won't let go. Fast adventure, fast action - and I loved the space-battles!\" - S. Arthur </p>";
