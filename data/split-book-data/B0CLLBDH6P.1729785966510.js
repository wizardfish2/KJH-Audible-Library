Unbeknownst to him, this grisly discovery marks the beginning of an entirely new chapter in his life. Upon mysteriously awakening in the hospital, he learns that his heart now functions flawlessly, and he feels… different.</p> <p>He soon discovers he has superhuman abilities—herculean strength, a marathon runner's stamina, and an extreme healing factor—as well as an ever-present assistant: a super-intelligent AI named Vega, telling him that his gift is the result of a network of nanomachines that he inherited like a virus from the dead body. And the dead man himself? A traveler from parts unknown, time unknown…</p> <p>Empowered by his newfound abilities, Kris embarks on a mission to track down the Quiet One, a domestic terrorist wreaking havoc on his city.</p> <p>In a fight spanning across continents, Kris must fight to learn and establish his true place in the world while uncovering the true nature of his otherworldly gift.</p>";
