window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cisco Suarez versus an entire Caribbean drug cartel. Round one. Fight. </p> <p>Okay, not exactly the most even championship match, but it's the one I drew. If you told me months ago I'd be robbing drug dealers, I would've committed you myself. Who needs that kind of trouble, right? </p> <p>The good news is I'm only after one man: Connor Hatch. The bad news is he's the new Pablo Escobar, a primal being, and all but untouchable. </p> <p>It gets worse. He's rounding up the Russian mob for something big, and I'm not the only spellslinger in the picture. They say follow the money or follow the drugs. Maybe I should keep an eye on who's following me. </p> <p>Some problems call for a delicate hand. I don't have those kinds of problems. </p>";
