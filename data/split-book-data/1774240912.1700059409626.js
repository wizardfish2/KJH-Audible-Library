A perilous quest into enemy stars.</b></p> <p>When the star system of Legatus was preparing to secede from the Protectorate of the Mage-King of Mars, it was the secret agents of the Legatan Military Intelligence Directorate that laid the groundwork and fought the covert war to make it happen.</p> <p>Now, as the open conflict draws to a bloody stalemate, LMID has been broken. Their leader is dead, murdered by agents of the Republic they helped birth. Their surviving agents have scattered, following a final protocol that orders them to defect to the Protectorate.</p> <p>An old friend brings all of this to Damien Montgomery, First Hand of the Mage-King, and begs for his help in unraveling the mystery. The only answers lie where the Hands of Mars should never go: on the worlds of the Republic.</p>";
