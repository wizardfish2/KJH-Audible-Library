A cosmic entity known as the System arrives, selecting him—a suburban father and engineer—as Earth's sole representative for integration. He has six months to say goodbye to his family before being exiled to another universe for over 400 years. Guided by an AI companion and gifted with powerful starting perks, Robert must navigate a new reality defined by levels, skills, magic, and dungeon crawls. From learning basic spells to crafting powerful artifacts and facing down monstrous foes, Robert races against time, not just for his own survival, but to prepare his loved ones and maybe even his planet for a future transformed by the System.</p>";
