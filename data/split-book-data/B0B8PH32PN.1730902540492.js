window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Journals of Minalan the Spellmonger.</b></p> <p>After his eventful trip to the non-magical molopor in the distant domain of Anghysbel, Minalan’s return to civilization and magic finds him challenged by the changes wrought in the crypt of Szal the Yith. With nine distinctive sets of memories, besides his own, Minalan struggles to define himself in a turbulent time.</p> <p>Things have never been more dire for the nascent Magelaw and the kingdom of Castalshar: the Duchy of Merwyn is encroaching the borders, the pirate realm of Farise is raiding shipping to a dreadful degree, and the dark lord Mycin Amana has captured Darkfaller, the largest castle in the land merely a few dozen miles away from the capital in the heart of the kingdom.</p> <p>While that brazen act halted the civil war brewing between the ascendent magi and the deteriorating aristocracy of knights, the Spellmonger’s influence and intervention has never been more important. But is he up to the task?</p> <p>With his brain buzzing with memories and feelings that aren’t his own and a list of vital tasks he must accomplish in order to save the world of Callidore from destruction, Minalan sets pen to parchment to chronicle his days in the heat of the struggle. His journal reveals the internal conflicts he battles, insights into his role and place in history, the difficulties managing his own political rise, and the constant effort of keeping his mind sharp enough to handle it all.</p> <p>Yet the cracks are showing. People are talking about the Spellmonger, who mutters to himself and indulges in strange practices. His moodiness and distraction are visible for all to see, eroding some people’s confidence in his ability to lead . . . and leading others who sense vulnerability to strike out at the master mage. Violent episodes and fits of melancholy punctuate his struggles with sanity. He details his self-doubts, his petty grievances, his deep brooding about his family and life in general, all as a means to keep himself sane.</p> <p>But people will whisper, and whisper they do. It’s becoming obvious: the Spellmonger has clearly become the Mad Mage of Sevendor!</p>";
