One man will learn how to unlock the powers of a small group of women and restore justice for all.</b></p> <p>Toby Drake is faced with a crisis of conscience when a beautiful woman shows up on his doorstep, battered, bloodied, and on run from a super-powered thug. Trained as an engineer prior to The Storm, Toby makes a living fixing other people’s broken electronics, hardly something that has prepared him to go up against a super.
