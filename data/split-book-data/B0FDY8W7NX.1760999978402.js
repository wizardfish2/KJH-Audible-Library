window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The complete series in a single offering!</b></p> <p>Toby Adams saved the world once before. Now he must do it again.</p> <p>The catch? This world isn’t Earth. It’s Eclipsia, a fantasy realm Toby visited as a kid. And he’s having a bit of trouble remembering how he accomplished his world-saving mission the first time.</p> <p>Magic was involved, he’s sure of that. Powerful companions, too. Possibly even a magical weapon of some kind.</p> <p>What Toby didn’t have the first time was a friend alongside him. Anna Coombes might be a human just like Toby, but she’s his best friend and would do anything for him. Including convincing a mature and alluring queen to ally with them (and commit some deeds that young Toby would never have considered).</p> <p>Eclipsia might be familiar, but Toby isn’t a kid anymore.</p>";
