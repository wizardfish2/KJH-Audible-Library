The god healed Dom and revealed information about how he ended up in Risona and that his family was in danger.</p> <p>With this information, Dom races across the kingdom to save his family, but his mind is filled with anxiety because of the warning Medum gave him. With the help of his family and others, Dom defeats the demonesses and allies they brought. After some interrogation, Dom finds out who is responsible. But even knowing that the noble is responsible, he realizes that something big is happening on Risona. Even though he doesn't want to be involved, Dom gets dragged in. He tries his hardest to stay in the shadows, but in the end, others will know his secret.</p> <p>In this journey, Dominic will go through tragedy and loss, but he gains allies and friends when others join his cause. Dom is also bombarded by kingdom and clan politics, not to mention commands from his patron god. A lot to go through by one man not from the world of Risona.</p> <p><i>The Traveler 4</i> is the fourth book in The Traveler series and contains mature content.</p>";
