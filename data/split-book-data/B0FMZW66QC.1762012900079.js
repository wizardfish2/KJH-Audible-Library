His people have been attacked, so it's time to do what a supervillain does best... get revenge. But even if he squashes the rival gang like a bug, other, more powerful foes are circling. Ranger is still hunting him, but he has a plan for the world's strongest man, while other threats south of the border have noticed the new player in town. To face them, he needs to master his magic and marshal his resources. Speaking of resources, there is a problem with the money. A problem he has to fix personally.</p> <p>Thankfully, he doesn't have to do it alone. With a blonde bombshell to help navigate high society, a mad scientist with increasingly more powerful iterations of armor, a spell slinger with once-in-a-generation talent, a money laundering pyro, and a ghost girl gathering the specters of Arch City to his banner, Grave is ready for whatever fight comes his way.</p> <p>This time, nothing will surprise him.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
