And further enemies stir in the dark....</b></p> <p>Will has managed to pull the four nearby dungeon cores together, but his creatures are woefully under-powered to meet the threats piling up against him and his people. He must build his dungeon and monsters to rise to the challenge these huge threats represent, all while keeping his fairies and dungeon friends safe and happy. </p> <p>Gar must bring his kingdom, nearby smaller peoples, and any portions of the great Kingdom of Eladrin he can convince to rebel together as part of his new Kingdom of Daruk, putting together a force capable of actually fighting the much larger and richer Kingdom of Eladrin. At the same time, he must wield his fractious adventuring company, Adamantâ€™s Own, as a power to feared. </p> <p>The Voidbringer corruption has spread wide. Anyone is a potential enemy, including current friends who can be turned into enemies. Can Will and Gar continue to grow and resist the monsters that confront them at every turn?</p>";
