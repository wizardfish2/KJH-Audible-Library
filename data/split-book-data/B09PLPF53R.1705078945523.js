Happiness?</b></p> <p>Dominic Hart was screwed.</p> <p>Diagnosed with terminal cancer, no money for treatment, and an athletic scholarship hanging by a thread...he didn't have many options. But the university clinic had offered him a <i>free video game</i>. Some sort of \"therapy\", they said. A way to while away the hours until he kicked the bucket. Yay.</p> <p>What Dom wasn't expecting was to get swindled by a surly casino owner right out of the gate. Or get dropped in a backwater hellhole voted the â€œnumber one worst starting location in Awaken Online\". That might have been because a video game mafia controlled the city. Or maybe it was because even the plant life could kill you. Regardless, his shit luck had obviously tagged along for the ride.</p> <p>But that's life. The odds are stacked in the house's favor, you're running out of chips, and you have to decide to hit or fold. For Dom, he decided to go all in. What did he really have to lose?</p> <p>It's just his life and happiness hanging in the balance.</p>";
