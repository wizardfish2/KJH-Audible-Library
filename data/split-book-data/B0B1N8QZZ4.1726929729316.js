Except instead of death, he and his Companion Pit were transported to the deadly Void, a place far worse than the Foglands. The Maw is there with them, bonded somehow to Felix in a way none of them understand, but all of them hate. </p> <p>The three must navigate the desolate expanse of the dark Void, contending with voidbeasts, marauders, and the creeping influence of the Maw itself.
