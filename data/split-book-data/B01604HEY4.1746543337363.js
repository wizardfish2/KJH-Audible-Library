window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There is a fine line between right and wrong, good and evil. For years Jason Burke has straddled that line as best he can, always convinced that despite the violence carried out by him and his team they were firmly on the right side of that line. But as he reflects on his time with Omega Force, he begins to have his doubts. </p> <p>When strange happenings from the mysterious Avarian Empire cross the expanse and Jason and Omega Force are pulled into the conflict, they must pick sides between two superpowers, all without knowing whom they can trust. At every turn, friends reveal themselves to be enemies, and enemies might be friends. All he knows for certain is that if they make it through the mission things will never be as they were. </p>";
