That's Vince. This is his big break from his days as a hired thug.</p> <p>Working for the mafia has a short life expectancy, though. Especially in a world where the masquerade shattered long ago. Demons run banks, birdfolk ferry people across town, and the police possess crack teams of sorcerers to keep the peace. Bad news for Vince and his dreams of mafia wealth.</p> <p>Not to mention that the corrupt mayor is backing the mafia's rivals or that Vince's usual employer doesn't appreciate his moonlighting. Plus, the don's sister is a wild one.</p> <p>Vince might not become a made man, but his future with the mob will make him or break him.</p>";
