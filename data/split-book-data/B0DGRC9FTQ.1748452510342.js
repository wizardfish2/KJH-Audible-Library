Yet the glory of leading the most elite team of magical mercenaries in existence cost him the only thing he ever loved.</p> <p>He’s done.</p> <p>Retired to a community of renegade fae, street-racing shifters, and fallen celestials, Zane’s quiet life on the beach comes with challenges no greater than finding a reason to get out of bed in the morning and knowing when to call it a night at the bar down the street.</p> <p>Zane may be done. But the Fae Wilds aren’t done with him.</p> <p>When a mysterious girl appears in Zane’s life with an artifact of surpassing power, Zane is pulled back into conflict with old enemies and old friends—friends who’ll find out what happens when you poke an old bear in his den.</p>";
