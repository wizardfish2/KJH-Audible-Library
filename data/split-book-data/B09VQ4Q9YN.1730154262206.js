As such it contains spoilers for the main series—you have been warned!</b></p> <p>Alex can’t wait to dive into the latest cutting-edge VRMMORPG: <i>Dungeon Core Online</i>. It boasts an ever-changing, ever-growing dungeon with an AI so advanced, it feels practically human. Funny huh?</p> <p>Forming a two-man dungeon party with his best friend, Fel, Alex is keen to sample everything DCO has to offer. From delicious fried Dicken to a fiery whiskey brewed from demonic corn, the friends eat and drink their way through the chaos that is <i>DCO</i>. Gaming is supposed to be fun after all, and leveling is always a little better when you’re tipsy right?</p> <p>It’s going to be a wild ride, with levels, achievements, bosses, and more–but mostly there's going to be a lot of Dicken around.</p> <p><i>Ever wanted to see Dungeon Core Online from the players' point of view? Well then pull up a chair, grab a piece of fried Dicken, and get ready for DCO as you have never seen it before in this low-stakes, shenanigans-filled buddy adventure!</i></p>";
