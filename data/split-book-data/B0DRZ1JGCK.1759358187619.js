window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Logan's empire of witches keeps growing...unfortunately.</b></p> <p>The funny thing is Logan isn't even trying to conquer the witching world one coven at a time. It just kind of works out that way because everyone and their mother wants to take out the Coven King. Now it isn't even just the witches that want him gone.</p> <p>A holy order of witch hunting knights has become aware of him, and Logan is on the defensive once more. Even more annoying, independent coven resistance groups across the country are flailing to obtain powerful weapons that might be enough to harm even the mighty Coven King himself. Honestly, he'd be happy to leave them alone if they could just do the same for him.</p> <p>But they won't, and he knows it by now. Logan isn't about to give up on his dream for a peaceful family life, so that means just one thing: He'll fight for his peace if he has to. He's come this far, hasn't he?</p>";
