window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Nico has faced threats from men, threats from dragons, and horrors beyond the physical world, but he's tired of reacting.</b></p> <p>Nico may like lying around on piles of gold, but that doesn't mean he's going to wait around any longer. He's going to take the initiative and that includes freeing the enslaved dragons and establishing Scale Nation, a place for all dragons.</p> <p>Of course, that's just a stepping stone to restoring the proper rulership of dragons.</p> <p>Book four in this series continues the same world-building and relationships but provides significant steps forward for Nico and Cami as well as a deeper understanding of the connection between the past and the present, the gods and the dragons.</p>";
