But for now, it can be delayed.</b></p> <p>After witnessing the devastation of the end of the world, Salvos returns to the Netherworld stronger than ever. She is still resolved to find her first companion, but the threat of corruption still weighs on her mind. Because she knows she has to speak to the one responsible for the Apocalypse. She knows she has to speak to her father—the Devil himself.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the Mortal Realm, all of humankind is still reeling from the revelation that their savior was a Demon in disguise. Nobody knows what to think—whether they have been tricked or they have been saved. But one girl knows the truth. Her name is Rachel, and she sets off to attend the prestigious Mavos Academy for one reason and one reason only: to follow in the footsteps of her idol and savior, Salvos.</p>";
