window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The truce between the vampires and the shifters is long over. So when the two factions stumble upon a lost fae warrior who has no idea what she is, all hell breaks loose.</p> <p>Charity hasn't had it easy. Growing up in a bad part of Chicago, left by her mother at sixteen, she's a survivor. So when she gets a scholarship to a good college out in California, she thinks all her dreams have come true.</p> <p>Instead, she falls head-first into a nightmare.</p> <p>At a posh party she doesn't belong, she gets the shock of her life: vampires and shifters are real! Magic is real. And she is anything but a mundane poor kid just trying to make it.</p> <p>Warrior runs in her blood. If only she knew how to use it.</p> <p>Suddenly she is trapped between two magical superpowers—a cunning elder vampire who wishes to use her for her blood ties and maybe tie her to the bed, and a sexy alpha shifter who will protect her at all costs. Her life of surviving could've never prepared her for this. And if she doesn't learn to harness the fae magic running through her blood, she'll be imprisoned forever.</p> <p>Performed by Jeri Marshall, Elena Anderson, Alexander Amado, Rayner Gabriel, Ian Putnam, Karenna Foley, Michael John Casey, Samantha Cooper, Robb Moreira, Amanda Forstrom, Drew Kopas, Alyssa Keegan, Renee Dorian, Julie Hoverson, Torian Brackett, Kevin Couto, Dawn Ursula, Cody Roberts, Lamont Ridgell, Ryan Carlo Dalusung, Matthew Bassett, Julienne Irons, and Ken Jackson.</p>";
