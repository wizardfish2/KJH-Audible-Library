He retired to a humble cottage built from the divine, wood of the World Tree that he chopped down.</p> <p>All was well until, one day, the world shook.</p> <p>The Hero wanted nothing to do with it and went to sleep. The next day, he went outside and saw that his property had been transferred to yet another world.</p> <p>Once more, he had been summoned, but this time, he refused it. He didn’t care. The Hero was done.
