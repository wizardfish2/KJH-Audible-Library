My journey has only just begun.</b></p> <p>Called to a fallen realm ruled by an imprisoned goddess, I have been tasked with slaying her captors and freeing her from her cage. I have defeated one already. Power, wealth–anything I could desire, has been promised if I can slay the rest.</p> <p>I am not alone on this quest. Joined by an oni veteran, a half-elf fire mage, a slime knight, and an imp rogue, I hunt the remaining betrayers. Our quest will take us to the depths of a corrupt, volcanic kingdom, and the haunted halls of star-worshiping cultists. Monsters and horrors fall to our might, and secret histories are laid bare.</p> <p><b>The only path before me is death or freedom, and I will be no one’s pawn.</b></p>";
