Again. But then, Moss is so familiar with rock bottom he has his mail forwarded there.</p> <p>Hel was born a slave, or maybe she wasn't. It's confusing, just like the compulsion that keeps her building... something. When she sees an opportunity to escape aboard a ship, she takes it, not realizing the trouble she's in for.</p> <p>Roy \"Hellno\" Herzog is a pirate who prefers to work alone. Now he's got a lead on a prize so big it could set him up for life, if he can stomach working with other people. All he has to do is track down one runaway slave.</p> <p>\"An action-packed space romp with a dry sense of humor that will appeal to fans of The Orville who wish that show was more like Firefly.\"â€”Marcus Alexander Hart of the Galaxy Cruise series</p>";
