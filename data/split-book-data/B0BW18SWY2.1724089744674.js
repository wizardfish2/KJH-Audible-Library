He’s gotten where he is by being stubborn and a chance to knock a corrupt bank down a peg is too good to pass up.</p> <p>But all isn’t well with his partners, the police’s elite Archangels. A new prototype model is about to be deployed, and she has her own views on humanity to force on her brethren. Nick feels more like an AI whisperer than a detective some days.</p> <p>Through it all, the city continues to smolder like a powder keg ready to blow. This case will determine more than the fate of a few banking executives.</p>";
