But especially when to run.</b><br> <br> Lily Red, known as \"Little Red\", has trained her entire life to become a system-acknowledged scout under her Grandmother's guidance. Hunting, tracking, and trap-making—she's a master of her craft. But her dreams of joining the elite Scout forces are repeatedly blocked by a leader of the Wyld with a grudge against Grandmother.<br> <br> When Lily uncovers an impending invasion by Wolf Warband, brutal raiders from the frozen north, a deadly challenge offered by their war leader sets her pulse racing. She's his partner in prophecy, so as far as he's concerned she's the only person in the way. Little Red races away to warn the Wyld, but the city's rulers mock her warnings as fairy tales, dismissing the threat entirely. Undeterred, she vows to protect the people of Canu Moch herself.<br> <br> But Lily isn't about to back down. She'll be the competent protector of the people of Canu Moch—whether they want her or not. With the three city-states planning to ignore the danger, she strikes out on her own, quickly finding herself on the razor's edge between duty and ambition as Little Red pits herself against the Big Bad Wolf.<br> <br> <b>Stay on the path. Don't stray or roam. Lest the forest decides you shan't find your way home.</b></p>";
