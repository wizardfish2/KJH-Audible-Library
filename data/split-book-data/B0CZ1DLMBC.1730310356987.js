window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sometimes, dungeon cells aren’t so bad</b></p> <p>I was hanging out with some buddies, doing a little caving, when everything went south. When I woke up, I was in some kind of medieval dungeon. Totally naked and in the dark.</p> <p>Luckily, I had a neighbor in a cell near me. One with a decidedly sexy feminine voice. When she explained to me that she was due to be executed and I was in line to be brainwashed, there was only one thing to do.</p> <p>We had to escape.</p> <p>Now, I’ve never been a Houdini type or any kind of super warrior, but once I got a look at my fellow prisoner, I knew I had to help her get free. Now I’m fleeing through a monster infested hellhole called the Dreadlands with the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever met. Oh, and did I mention she has furry ears and a tail? Yeah. H-O-T!</p> <p>This was just the start. I was hit rapid-fire with a bunch of other surprises. Starting with my magnificent fox girl being a priestess of a sex goddess. Uh-huh. Followed closely by the news that her fellow priestesses were being hunted to extinction. She needed my help.</p> <p>Maybe, just maybe, I’d give this world a try before figuring out how to get back home.</p>";
