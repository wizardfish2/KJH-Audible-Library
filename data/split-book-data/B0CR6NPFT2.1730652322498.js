window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>To save her town from decaying into oblivion, a young seamstress embarks on a quest that weaves together magic, mystery, and monsters.</b></p> <p>In an impoverished border town with a population dwindling as fast as hope, Gwen Tailor aims to change things. She is a daughter of the Seamstress class, drawing on the bloodline skills of her mother, who stitches with a speed that veers into the realm of magic. An awesome feat. But armed with a giant piercing needle, Gwen is more than a seamstress. To save her people from extinction and create a pattern all her own for survival, she must be a monster slayer.</p> <p>In the core of the town is the dungeon, a deep-pitted breeding ground for all the local despair and decline. Gwen is going where the monsters dwell. For every new kill, each creature's pelt, shell, and exoskeleton will become not only protective armor but a source of escalating power. With the help of her friends—Sandy, a cleaver-wielding butcher's daughter, and Gerald, a young blacksmith with near-wizardly talents for forging enchanted weapons—Gwen has a team to be reckoned with. Monsters, beware.</p> <p>Would that it were so simple. Descending into each cavernous new level, Gwen will make a harrowing discovery about the true roots of her town's decay. And they are more overwhelming and far-reaching than she ever could have imagined . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than 500,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
