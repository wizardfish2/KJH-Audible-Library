window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Raised in the small town of Wushan, Linley is a scion of the Baruch clan, the clan of the once-legendary Dragonblood Warriors. Their fame once shook the world, but the clan is now so decrepit that even the heirlooms of the clan have been sold off. Their prospects seem dire...and yet, perhaps some power still remains within the veins of the clan. Dragons do not easily die, and neither do the dragonblooded.&nbsp;</p> <p>Come witness a new legend in the making. The legend of Linley Baruch.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the first of eight fantasy novels comprising the translation of the seminal 'Coiling Dragon Saga' by famous Chinese author Wo Chi Xi Hong Shi, originally hosted on www.wuxiaworld.com.
