window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The great spheres and probes of Artifice, humankind's enemy, haunt every inhabited world near and far. The Omnians' long and arduous search for Artifice has ended. They've located Artifice's lair in the Talus system.</p> <p>The sentient digital entity rules a vast swath of worlds, known as the federacy, through ruthless intimidation. Its insidious programs are embedded in every races' digital systems - warships, shuttles, stations, domes, comm platforms, and power plants. One misstep by a race could see its citizens exterminated in vast numbers. The survivors, if there were any, would be thrown back to the days before spaceflight.</p> <p>Artifice has had millennia to secure its base. Powerful battleship fleets guard the system's periphery and the approaches above and below the entity's planet, Toral. Probes surround the system and warn of unauthorized encroachment, and Artifice has control of the planet's army of bots.</p> <p>The Omnian expeditionary fleet, led by Alex Racine, desperately needs allies in order to defeat or circumvent Artifice's defensive measures. The Omnians are curious about the fleet of black-hulled battleships, which bear a resemblance to Artifice's probes and guard the Talus system. The SADEs, the Omnians' digital friends, believe that the sentients aboard the black fleet and Artifice share a common history.</p> <p>Whether or not the Omnians can gather allies, they don't intend to abandon their goal and return to Omnia. They mean to capture or destroy the entity, Artifice, or die trying.</p>";
