window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Everyone deserves to get away for a bit. Even the miscreants at St Mary's. </p> <p>Astonishingly, Dr. Bairstow has declared a holiday. Even more astonishingly - he's paying for it. Needless to say, there are strings attached. They have to record the 1601 performance of <i>Hamlet</i>, with Shakespeare himself in the role of the Ghost. It doesn't go well, of course. </p> <p>With Dr Bairstow and Mrs Mack turning a simple visit to a street market into a public brawl, Professor Rapson inadvertently stowing away on a vessel bound for the New World, and Shakespeare himself going up in flames, it would seem that Max, of all people, is the only one actually completing the assignment. </p>";
