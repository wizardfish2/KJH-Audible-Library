Maybe a bowl of noodles. Definitely some peace and quiet on humanity's newly liberated fragment of Earth. But when Little Earth's miraculous transformation starts turning deadly, he discovers that saving the world was the easy part. Now he has to survive in it.</p> <p>Which would be a lot easier if a faction of powerful beings known as Chi Hunters weren’t hell bent on hunting him down.</p> <p>On the run and armed with antique weapons, half-cooked “plans,” and a stolen spacecraft that smells like death warmed over, Dalton must race to find his lost ship before the wrong people find him first. But in a universe where dragons are real, planets can vanish, and the line between hero and wanted fugitive is drawn in disappearing ink, the mission is a lot easier said than done. Adrift, on the run, and in way over his head, some beacons are meant to guide you home. Others are meant to lure you to your doom.</p> <p>And Captain Dalton Thorne can never tell the difference.</p> <p><i>The irreverent sci-fi adventure continues with twice the snark, three-point-five times the danger, and absolutely zero improvement in Dalton's decision-making skills. Perfect for fans of space opera with an 80’s action movie vibe, reluctant heroes who complain their way to victory, and anyone who thinks the galaxy could use more sarcasm per square parsec.</i></p>";
