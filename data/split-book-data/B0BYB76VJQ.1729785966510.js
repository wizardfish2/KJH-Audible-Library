So when I move an adolescent dragon into my backyard, why don't I anticipate the craziness that will ensue?</p> <p>Maybe Sloan's right and I am ridiculous. I like to think I'm an optimist. Either way, it takes a group effort to figure out the mess we find ourselves in and what to do about it.</p> <p>The good news is, we may be able to reclaim our lives. The bad news? We may alter the course of the future in the process.
