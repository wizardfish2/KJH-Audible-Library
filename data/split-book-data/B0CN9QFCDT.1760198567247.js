As a monstrous swarm of enormous wasp-like creatures, called Vespae, prepare to invade, it’s up to Anthony and his ragtag crew to make the impossible…slightly less impossible.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the deadly creatures lurking in the wilds aren’t Anthony’s only problem. His past triumphs have made him a target for the vindictive system administrators—not to mention a host of bloodthirsty villains, who now have him firmly in their crosshairs. As a result, the rules of the game are changing in a way he can no longer anticipate.</p> <p>To pull victory from the jaws of defeat, Anthony will need to navigate the hostile wilderness, build some unlikely alliances, and find a way to unify Etson’s divided factions. </p> <p>This is the 100th Run. Failure isn’t an option, and if the city can’t repel the invasion, the Vespae will conquer, and Anthony's dream of a golden age will died, before it even begins.</p>";
