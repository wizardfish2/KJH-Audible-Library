He needs a crusade.</b></p> <p>Commander Jay Luckrun is a bit more than a dorky weirdo these days. He's a dungeon crawler of the multiverse and a relentless killer of thousands of men and monsters. People think he's to blame for the spread of the apocalypse, too! Some of that might be true, but Jay still thinks of himself as a hero of comedy.</p> <p>But when a secretive group of villains gets empowered by the System and attacks the people close to Jay, he might have to lean into his infamy more. He might have to go all out to seek vengeance. At the very least, his next rank evolution will be the greatest evolution anyone has ever seen on Earth.</p> <p>Jay will gain more stats, skills, loot, and magical items that are more powerful than ever before. He will go on a global journey that will help him refine his fighting abilities and turn him into a stronger warrior. Will that be enough? Will his mission to defeat the oldest enemies overturn all the suffering and push the world in a new direction?</p> <p>Jay has no idea. But you know what... Regardless of the challenges, it's time for a change. It's time for a crusade.</p>";
