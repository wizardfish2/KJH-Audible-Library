window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The only way out is down.</b></p> <p>Accompanied by an automaton her mother left before her disappearance, Clare has discovered the way into the upper regions of the mysterious and forbidden lower city. But now, encountering a strange new machine that sounds eerily human and claims to know the way down into the lower levels, the real adventure begins.</p> <p>At first, Clare and her assistant hope to advance without notice, but when the automaton army meets their intrusion with more than just hydraulic-assisted, mechanical muscle, they realize they have little choice - cooperate or die an agonizing death.</p> <p>From above, Waine and Oswald are hot on their trail - one moved by duty, the other by friendship. As they're hindered by the host of demonized machinery left in Clare's wake, they must fight increasingly desperate odds that drive both men to final, impossible choices. </p> <p>Avoiding her pursuers of bone and battery alike, Clare must penetrate even further into the industrial abyss in search of her mother.</p> <p>Who, or what lies at the bottom?</p> <p><b>This is the second book in Substation 7, the oppressive fantasy thriller series in which even the afterlife can be stolen from you!
