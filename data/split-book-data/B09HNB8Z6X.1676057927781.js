Nothing about it is like the old VR games of yesteryear, and he isn’t just talking about how oddly real the non-player characters act.</p> <p>While the game might just be incredibly realistic and nothing more, the problems he faces are quite real. Now that he has left the Village of Beginnings, his goal is clear: Continue to level up, rise in fame, and help Fayte win her bet against Levon Ploenexia. And the best way to do that is to make sure he and his new companions acquire some unique hidden classes!</p>";
