window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two things are impossible to walk away from: death and vintage clothing. Trust me. I've tried.</b><br> <br> Moving across the country and opening a costume shop was supposed to be my chance for a normal life. What I wanted was a fresh start, one where the biggest danger would be a carelessly wielded sewing needle.<br> <br> What I ended up with was a trail of dead bodies, a power I didn't ask for, and a host of enemies with ties to my twin sister's decade-old murder. Throw in a stony-eyed enforcer I can't seem to shake and a new goat shifter BFF, and I'm knee deep in trouble. <br> <br> Walking away from this alive is going to require more than my wicked fashion sense. To survive, I'll have to embrace the legacy I've spent most of my life running from.</p> <p><b>The Kali James series features a reluctant necromancer who finds herself in a world of witches, werewolves, vampires, and ghosts. If you like your urban fantasy with quirky characters, found family, a side of supernatural mystery, and a dose of slow-burn romance, this is the series for you.</b></p>";
