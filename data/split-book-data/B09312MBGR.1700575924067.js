Can't get enough </b><b><i>Killjoys</i></b><b>? Then this series is for you. </b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Karin Makos lives a lie. Genetically engineered from birth and raised in a scientific compound to gain unnatural powers, she has since escaped and built a new life hidden from those who created her. For her, the chance to pilot a small-time scrounging vessel to remote corners of space is the dream. After years on the run with her sister and enduring the constant paranoia of living planet-side, going off-radar gives her exactly what she wants: freedom.</p> <p>In a single night, that dream is shattered.</p> <p>A system-wide attack decimates humanity, and the few insubstantial clues they have point straight back into her past and the horrors it holds. Plagued by strange dreams of her sister and a sense of growing danger, Karin and the crew of the Nemina must race desperately across space to find their loved ones - and answers.</p> <p><b>So starts The Eurynome Code, a fast-paced space opera in the same veins as </b><b><i>Firefly</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Killjoys</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>Battlestar Galactica</i></b><b>.
