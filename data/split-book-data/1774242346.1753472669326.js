A looming cataclysm.</b></p> <p>Now that Drew has become even more powerful by stepping into the Foundation Realm, new challenges await him. He is quietly growing his school and sect, and allowing his students to recruit whoever they want so he can take it easy.</p> <p>Trouble looms as his old mistakes come back to haunt him. The entire planet is about to be sent down a savage and unforgiving path, and it <i>might</i> be his fault. Monsters are popping up everywhere, packs of deadly animals led by terrible mutants.

They seem to be steered by some higher power, some nefarious being that holds the reins of the planet.</p> <p>His students have turned from bright-eyed, eager learners...into lazy good-for-nothings. Whoops. It seemed he was too influential in their development. Teach now has to spend large amounts of time crafting gear for all the new recruits, and the rising tensions are giving him a headache.</p> <p>Teach might just decide to end them all. He had a fresh start once â€¦ maybe he should try again?</p>";
