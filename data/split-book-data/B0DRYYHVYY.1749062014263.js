Yet, time is also an enemy, a clock ticking down to the death of humanity—and faster than Nick knows. The clandestine Forebears of Ingenga snake their shadowy tendrils through every echelon of society in an effort to expedite the end, and after Nick foiled their plans once, their crosshairs have settled on him and his burgeoning guild. Meanwhile, Nick trains tirelessly and takes on dungeons with his team, but he remains focused on the Endless Night, the day the Apocalypse truly began in his last life, the day horrific monsters, dragons, and flesh-hungry demons rip an unsealable rift between their world and his.<br> <br> The Endless Night is Nick’s nightmare and Ingenga’s dream. But will Nick and his friends survive the reality?</p> <p><b>When time weighs heavily, it's time to hit the weights in this regression LitRPG/Gamelit story of dungeon-diving, leveling, stats, and facing down the apocalypse!</b></p>";
