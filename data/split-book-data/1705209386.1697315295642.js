The quantum world doesn't play by those rules.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Daniel Rice is a government science investigator whose specialty is solving seemingly intractable problems through scientific inquiry.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Daniel's intellectual strength is sorely tested by the bizarre realities he finds in the quantum world.

The other side of the mirror is a place full of dangers, but it's also somewhere a dedicated scientist can uncover secrets that connect humans with something greater.</p>";
