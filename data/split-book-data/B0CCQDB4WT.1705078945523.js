A member of the famed and prestigious Galactic Rangers, Lennox is charged with keeping the peace in a galaxy that is increasingly torn with tension. He's never failed to put the bad guys away, but his reckless, devil-may-care ways have earned him the wrath of his commanding officers.</p> <p>And yet, a grave threat to galaxy has the brass so scared, they willingly unleash him to find the answers.</p> <p>It’s up to Lennox and Anna—his distractingly beautiful partner—to uncover a hidden threat behind a series of domestic bombings that continue to escalate.
