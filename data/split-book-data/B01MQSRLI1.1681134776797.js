window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Best-selling author Jodi Taylor returns with a brand-new Chronicles of St Mary's short story. </p> <p>Like a smaller and much scruffier Greta Garbo - finally - Markham speaks! </p> <p>It's Christmas and time for the first (and almost certainly last) St Mary's Annual Children's Christmas Party - attendance compulsory, by order of Dr Bairstow. Discovered practising his illegal reindeer dance and poo-dropping routine, our hero, along with fellow disaster magnets Peterson and Maxwell, is dispatched to Anglo-Saxon England to discover the truth about Alfred and the cakes. In his own words, our hero reveals Major Guthrie's six-point guide to a successful assignment and the Security Section's true opinion of the History Department. And of historians in general. And of one historian in particular. </p> <p>And, just to be clear, it is time travel, for God's sake. Forget all that pretentious 'investigating major historical events in contemporary time' rubbish. This is history without the capital <i>H</i>. Because this is the way the Security Section rolls! </p>";
