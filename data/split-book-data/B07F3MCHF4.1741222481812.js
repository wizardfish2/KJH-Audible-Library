window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Welcome to the long-awaited seventh novel of the best-selling saga by Aleron Kong. </b><br> <b> The longest and best book ever recorded by Nick Podehl!</b></p> <p><b><i>The Land: Founding</i></b><b>, Book 1 of the Chaos Seeds Saga, reached number one in the Audible store in 2017! </b></p> <p><b>A mesmerizing tale reminiscent of the wonder of </b><b><i>Ready Player One</i></b><b> and the adventure of </b><b><i>Game of Thrones</i></b></p> <p><b>Number one in epic fantasy, cyberpunk, and video game fantasy </b></p> <p>In <i>The Land: Predators</i>, the Mist Village has harnessed its power. With core buildings, Professional fighters, and now their own Dungeon, the settlement is primed to grow into a kingdom of true power and magic. The path to power has not been without risk, however. The Mist Village has been noticed.</p> <p>Evil nobles from the Kingdom of Law, bloodthirsty goblins from the Serrated Mountains, an undead lord with a penchant for human sacrifice, and fanatical kobolds from the Depths all plot the village's destruction. The predators are circling. Richter's people are horribly outnumbered by foes whose own power has been entrenched for thousands of years.</p> <p>Richter and Sion need to be stronger than ever before. Luckily, they are. New skills have been learned, stronger enchantments have been wrought, and the hundreds of villagers have answered the call to adventure. The Companions do not stand alone. While many eyes have turned toward the mists, wanting to take the treasures within, the Mist Village stares back with a simple message.</p> <p>Come and get it!</p>";
