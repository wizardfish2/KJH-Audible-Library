Only Ben and his childhood love, Emma, survived. But when the doorway to the hidden world closed, Ben was trapped on the wrong side. </p> <p>Now, Emma has waited 10 long years for the doorway to open again. This time sheâ€™d be ready. This time she had everything she needed to go back to that hellish place and survive. All she needed was for Ben to be alive when she got there.</p>";
