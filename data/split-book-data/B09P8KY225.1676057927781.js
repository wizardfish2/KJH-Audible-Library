Instead of bleeding out on the sand like they hoped, I used the power of my gifted core to rise. When I learned my enemies held a cure for the spreading plight of infertility, I knew why my gods had sent me.</p> <p>I am Dagon Haldorson, hunter and hearthman of the northern shores of Enea. I will grow in strength, form alliances, and win the hearts of gorgeous battle brides. And, by uncovering the lost secrets of cultivation, we may go one step further.</p> <p>Together, we might change the world.</p> <p><b>Warning: This book contains graphic violence, adult themes, and unconventional relationships.</b></p>";
