After entering a contract as a small coven's Greater Familiar, he didn't have many aspirations beyond enjoying his new life and relationships. But then things just kind of... happened.</p> <p>Next thing he knew, Logan had dominated hundreds, going on thousands of witches, and that number is set to climb. It wasn't that he wanted to, mind you. In most cases, they forced his hand, doubting his status as the Inevitable Coven King of prophecyâ€”the very first since Merlin himself.</p> <p>But overseas, another Coven King, a lesser one, but much more aggressive, has been conquering the covens of Europe. Now, Otto has come to the Land of the Free in search of Logan to settle things once and for all. The two men, and their covens, now must enter a tournament to decide somewhat amicably the fate of all witchkind. Will they end up subjugated by the European Coven King, keeper of feet-related secrets that Logan yearns to understand better... or will Logan win the day, bring all of witchdom into his fold, thereby freeing them in a roundabout sort of way?</p> <p><b>One thing's for sure: you've never heard a finale like this.</b></p>";
