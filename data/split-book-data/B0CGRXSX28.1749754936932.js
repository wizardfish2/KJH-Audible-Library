As Luc Vale, the mortal mage, I’ll live out a real life and become an adventurer.<br> <br> But first, I must master this world’s new magic at the Tower Guild Academy. After forming a party with a gorgeous and clumsy woman, I learned that being human is nothing like I imagined.<br> <br> Not only is my new, smelly body weaker than I’m used to, I’ve also discovered the distractions of carnal pleasure. All is going according to plan, until a danger emerges that threatens all of Ria. I should be strong enough to vanquish the Tower’s dark secret. As long as no one discovers who I truly am....</p> <p>If you like light-hearted romance, quirky humor, and a dash of adventure, this story is for you.<br> <br> Great for anime weebs who enjoy shows like <i>How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord.<br> </i><br> (Contains unconventional relationships and adult situations).</p>";
