window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Principal Investigator of the Chaalt people has covertly enlisted the aid of Nathan Myers and the crew of the Legacy. They desperately need help gaining access to their secret Prule research station. The facility has gone dark, and the automated defenses activated. Even the Chaalt's own advanced warships were not able to breach the shield dome and disable the cutting edge weaponry that protects the base. Nathan and his crew are in a race against time, because they believe a Prule Hivemind they once captured, now controls the facility. If the Hivemind is able to assimilate the Chaalt tech, it could escape and endanger the entire galaxy. If it can return to Andromeda, the Prule will reverse engineer the technology and return with the means to prevail in the second invasion of the Milky Way galaxy. Nathan, Justice, and the crew of the Legacy will do whatever it takes to prevent that outcome, or die trying.</p>";
