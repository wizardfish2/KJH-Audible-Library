window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Netherworld: it is a hellish landscape inhabited only by demons, creatures born from the dark abyss. It is also the only world Salvos knows. </b></p> <p>Joining the ranks of newborn demons, Salvos is thrown into the violent, anarchy-ruled landscape of that world. To survive, she will have to learn, she will have to adapt, and she will have to <i>evolve</i>. She <i>will</i> gain experience to reach new Levels of power.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her curiosity aids her but her pride could be her fall. It is the nature of the Netherworld to avoid or conquer any threats faced. After all, the law of evolution is survival of the fittest, and Salvos is a survivor. And perhaps, eventually, she will leave this world behind for a better place. But is that what she even wants?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Salvos is a monster evolution litRPG series that follows the adventures of a Demon girl. It is set inside a game-like world with classes and levels, but it is not inside the world of a video game.</i></p>";
