window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The frozen world of Asarus, a critical lifeline for the colonies, is under siege by an icy demonic horde unlike anything humanity has faced. The Hellmarine and his squad are sent in to contain the chaos, but this time, the stakes are personal. As memories of a forgotten past claw their way to the surface, the unstoppable juggernaut finds himself haunted by more than just demons.</p> <p>With the Overmaiden orchestrating from the skies, Seraphiel watching his back, and a mysterious face from his old life stirring questions he’s not ready to answer, the Hellmarine must carve his way through legions of profane ice monsters to stop a Voivode powerful enough to warp reality itself.</p> <p>But this isn’t just war anymore—it’s survival. The cold burns, the ice corrupts, and the Hellmarine’s unyielding rage might not be enough to save Asarus...or himself.</p> <p>And that's only the opening chapters.</p> <p><i>Hellmarine 2: Neck Deep in Demon Blood</i> takes the carnage and chaos to the next level with more action, more lore, and more Hellmarine fury. The fight for humanity’s future has never been deadlier—or more personal.</p>";
