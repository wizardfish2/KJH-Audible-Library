Then they never shut up. </b></p> <p>Life is finally going right for Lazarus Kerrigan, necromancer and Pale Horseman. Business is booming, and no gods have tried to kill him for a whole month. But the past is catching up to him. </p> <p>There's a serial killer on the loose in New Orleans, one that targets children and leaves behind only bones. When the case develops eerie similarities to his sister's murder, Laz knows the police are in over their heads. They need help, and the dead aren't talking. </p> <p>Well, except for the ghost of a 200-year-old pirate, and Laz doesn't like what he has to say. If he's right, the creature Laz is chasing is a monster way out of his league. If he's not careful, Laz might just end up in Davey Jones's Locker, or worse....</p>";
