window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Max was a professional soldier, and extremely good at his job. Right up until it killed him. </p> <p>At the moment of his death, he meets Hildi the Valkyrie, and is given three options. Serve Odin in Valhalla as one of the Einherjar, fighting each day and celebrating each night until the battle of Ragnarok. Accept his death as final, and end his existence. Or be reincarnated as a Battleborne on a random unknown world. </p> <p>Max chooses to gamble! To live a new life, whatever that might entail. Favored with a blessing of the Valkyries, who gift him with an unusual bloodline, he is reborn on a world of magic and monsters. In fact, his own new body is half monster! </p> <p>Thrust into the world with nothing but a canvas diaper, sharp teeth, and claws, Max must use his skills as a soldier to improvise and survive. There are no respawns, and at level zero, nearly everything can kill him. </p> <p>With his new status as one of the Battleborne, much is expected of Max. Dangerous and difficult quests are presented to him, and the loot ranges from filthy goblin loincloths to epic weapons! </p> <p>Join Max as he learns to navigate his new life, struggling with the instincts of his monster bloodlines, and taking advantage of them at the same time.</p>";
