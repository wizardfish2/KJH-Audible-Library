window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Complete Space Opera Series boxed set.</p> <p>A young explorer finds an alien space pod in the frozen tundra, which leads to an interplanetary chase and space battle.</p> <p>Plenty of action, epic original worldbuilding, and enjoyable moments with colorful characters. This series has all the right elements for a terrific alien contact space opera. And the ending is both surprising and satisfying!</p> <p>This boxed set contains all three books in the Lost Colony Uprising series:</p> <p><b>Book 1: </b><b><i>Starship Relic</i></b></p> <p>Ancient technology. Secret histories. And squids. In space.</p> <p>Max is completing a survey in the barren, frozen north of planet Grailliyn, when he makes a startling discovery. There's a high-tech pod buried beneath the ice, and inside the pod is a young woman. She speaks his language, but with a strange accent.</p> <p>The two are barely past awkward introductions when they are attacked. Max and his new friend are forced to flee. The worst part? They don't even know who is trying to kill them, or why.</p> <p>Now, with assassins on their tail, the duo must find a way off the planet without blowing their cover. And then, if they can do that without getting eaten by space monsters, they might just find out the truth about their world.</p> <p><i>Starship Relic</i> is book one of the Lost Colony Uprising Trilogy, a sci-fi space opera adventure with spaceships, alien contact, deep conspiracies, wise-cracking characters, and lots of pew-pew (space battle action).</p> <p><b>Book 2: </b><b><i>Starship Invasion</i></b></p> <p>Alien threats. Planetary invasion. And space squids.</p> <p>When Snow was a young girl, she was cautioned against pressing big red buttons of any kind. As a responsible crew member of Starship Longissima, Snow took this warning to heart.</p> <p>Then she forgot that promise, along with everything about her former life. When she was found by Max, asleep in the ice, neither of them had any idea what destructive events were about to be set in motion.</p> <p>Now the red buttons (big ones) have been pressed, and there will be tragic consequences.</p> <p>The planet of Grailliyn is suffering an invasion on a global scale.</p> <p>With limited resources at hand, Snow and her new allies must find a way to stop the annihilation, or, failing that, evacuate as many of their people as possible before abandoning the planet of Grailliyn to the enemy, forever.</p> <p><b>Book 3: </b><b><i>Starship Overlords</i></b></p> <p>Ancient alien technology. Unlikely allies. And a chance to strike back.</p> <p>The twin planets of Grailliyn and Mega are once again under threat.</p> <p>A new menace has arrived. A fleet of alien warships.</p> <p>While the Earthlings continue to evacuate Grailliyn, Commander Carrack must call for help, enlisting potential new allies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Max, Snow, and the crew of the Dee-Dub continue searching for Alien technology. Their mission turns up an ancient secret that could change everything.</p> <p>At last, the Earthlings may have a chance to strike back against the evil Overlords that threaten the entire galaxy.</p> <p><i>Starship Overlords</i> is book three of the Lost Colony Uprising Trilogy, a sci-fi space opera adventure with spaceships, alien contact, deep conspiracies, wise-cracking characters, and lots of pew-pew (space battle action).</p> <p>Content rating: All ages, teen and up.
