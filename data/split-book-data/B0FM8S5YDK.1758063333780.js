It is now time to establish my Demonic Sect, recruit members, and make a name for myself.</b></p> <p>At least, that is how it should have been.</p> <p>Hostile upperclassmen, mysterious professors, stuck-up nobles, and a demonic invasion that I know will hit the academy, all loom over me. As do the vampire, werewolf, and phoenix girls around me.</p> <p>Hopes for learning and growth rapidly transform into stealth and survival as I hide from Holy Knights pursuing a 'demon' in the academy, and demons hunt for whoever is using their power.</p> <p>The academy’s peace is destined to shatter, and I may have to risk my dark energy being revealed to protect it the best I can.</p> <p>Thankfully, I am not alone. With loyal allies by my side and the three special women I have become close to, we can face all adversities and come up ahead. Becoming stronger is certainly not easy. But there is one truth I have long since understood after all my adventures in this new world.</p> <p>Power has its price, and I’m willing to pay it.</p>";
