She's risen above the pain of her beginnings to become a war hero only to leave it all behind in the pursuit of a simple life. Now a salvager, she makes a living sifting through the wreckage of dead alien ships from a war that nearly brought humanity to its knees.</p> <p>After her ship takes damage, she's forced to re-route to a space station where her past and present collide with dangerous consequences.</p> <p>Kira's existence holds the key to a faltering peace treaty with the Tuann - a technologically advanced alien race who dislikes and distrusts all humans. Winning her freedom should be easy, but a powerful and relentless Tuann warrior stands in her way. Deceiving him seems impossible, especially when he strays dangerously close to secrets she struggles to hide.</p> <p>Can Kira reconcile the pain of her past with the possibilities of her future? The fate of two races depends on her success.</p>";
