A situation involving Tongsta, their pets, and the galaxy as a whole. One that's going to need his help to fix it, whether anyone wants it to happen, including Wrench or not.</p> <p>He's been dumped into an unfamiliar Hab after having survived a pirate attack with his Tongsta, Goodie. She's likely recovering somewhere after being wounded, so he can't look to her for help.</p> <p>Stripe and Seventh are here as well, and his first goal is to find them. Which will likely require him to fix anyone and anything that gets in his way.</p> <p>Good thing he's well suited to fixing problems. After all, most issues only need a great deal of violence to be solved. Wrench has lots of that in his toolbox to go around.</p>";
