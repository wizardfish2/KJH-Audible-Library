window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Defy the inevitable. Such is the stance of Confederation captain Eric Weston and the crew of the starship <i>Odysseus</i>, patrolling the outer limits of Priminae space, anticipating the Empire's next attacks. Connected with the Terran FTL tech - the transition drive - humanity might stand a chance against the overwhelming forces. Until the entire planetary system goes dark. </p> <p>Outnumbered and outgunned, the <i>Odysseus</i> arrives to find the Empire securing critical intelligence from Priminae ships - data that could prove disastrous in the wrong hands. </p> <p>As the <i>Odysseus</i> enters the fray, the ship's systems exhibit increasingly chaotic glitches, while haunting apparitions stalk the crew. As they struggle to control their own ship - and their sanity - against the tide of battle, how can they hope to grasp victory when the <i>Odysseus</i> itself appears to be coming to life? </p>";
