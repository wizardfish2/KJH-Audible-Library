Clawing his way into the elite ranks of Ballum's Fist, the man hoped to rouse his dormant core. After every elixir of awakening failed, however, he relinquished such dreams in the hopes of returning home.</p> <p>Yet even that is torn away when he and his men collide with an unexpected fate. Facing a monk from distant Shuya, who wields not one but all of the elements, Luca is forced to question all he knows about cultivation.</p> <p>Our exiled hero will find a new purpose. Luca must gather allies, battle Mana Beasts, and ascend his core as quickly as possible. For once he has taken this terrible power unto himself, enemies arise from the distant reaches of Andaya.</p> <p>Through it all, Luca learns one undeniable fact: Wielding the power of the gods is not for the weak of heart.</p> <p><i>First Fist is a progression fantasy series that contains elements of cultivation, LitRPG, sect- and base-building, light crafting, and epic fantasy. It does not contain sex or explicit content.</i></p> <p><i>This is a remastered edition that includes some changes from the original.
