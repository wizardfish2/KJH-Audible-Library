All but two cities have fallen and their forces are dwindling by the day. With little choice remaining, Morgan sets out on his own to try and convince the rulers of the other Kingdoms to join in their cause.

Still, for the sake of everyone in the Five Kingdoms, he has to try, even if it costs him everything. </p> <p><b>Warning: This book contains profanity, gore, and content that may not be suitable for children.
