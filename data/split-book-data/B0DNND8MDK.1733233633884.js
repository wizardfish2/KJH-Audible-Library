window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After a long march across the empire, Gregory finally made it to Krogga. Ambassador Rudit Glowstone, Grandmaster of Aether’s Guard, greeted him upon his arrival in the capital. After a brief meeting, she let him go to his wives and friends, arranging for them to have the few days off that Yukiko had requested. That was why Gregory spent his first two days in Krogheim going through the steps required to marry Ling, Clover, and Roshana.</p> <p>Gregory had to fight his way to the temple as per tradition, even having to put down a berserker champion who had stood in his way— the locals accepted the match as being honorable, as the berserker’s bloodlust ensured that one of the two of them was going to die. Gregory was allowed to marry his three friends in a ceremony that barely deviated from local customs. He spent the next two days with his new wives, then all of his wives, making sure all of their desires were thoroughly met.</p> <p>Because Gregory had killed a champion on his way to the temple, the Krogheim council asked to speak with him. His prowess and acceptance of their local customs had them extend an invitation for the new year festival to the embassy, but specifically to Gregory and Jenn, as both had proven their strength to the Kroggians. The festival led to new connections with the other ambassadors, most of whom promised to visit after the week-long festival.</p> <p>Jenn and Gregory found themselves in the finals of the festival duels, but both would end up facing the newest high champion of Krog, Ragnar Ivarson. The massive warrior defeated Jenn with her chosen fighting style of speed and his skill with weapons. When Gregory and Ragnar fought, though, small problems crystallized. Ragnar wasn’t just a high champion— he was Krog reborn. Having found Aether again, he promised that they would talk soon, and he’d even bring his sister with him.</p>";
