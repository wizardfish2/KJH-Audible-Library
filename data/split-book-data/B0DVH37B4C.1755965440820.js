Sort of.</p> <p>Nyx and his dysfunctional family have finally escaped the clinging, toxic confines of the Flow’s sphincter—aka, a silver-ranked “corrupted gate.”</p> <p>And what better way to celebrate their newfound freedom than a family vacation? One filled with all the classics. Songs, games, epic monsters, unnecessary crafting projects, delicious and gratuitous descriptions of food, flesh-eating bamboo forests, and strange new cities. But, most importantly, family bonding time.</p> <p>Time spent teasing out Fang and Lili’s soul-wrenching secrets, making memories with their beautiful, ruby-eyed murder babies, and setting up Horus and Eris on a romantic getaway of their own. All to avoid addressing the many, many narrative questions that have begun piling up.</p> <p>Like why does Nyx have so many skills? What will happen to him after eating those skill gems? Will Horus and Eris finally admit their feelings? Did Emporos ever publish Horus’ diary? Will Demi keep climbing the corporate spiritual ladder?</p> <p>And, uh, why does Nyx keep talking to a ghostly army of “himselves?”</p> <p>So, just a totally normal family roadtrip ...</p>";
