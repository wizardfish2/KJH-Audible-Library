window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Captain Carter Riley's last stand on Mars was meant to be his end. Instead, it sparked a new beginning. In the 22nd century, Riley's life is upended by an alien attack that leaves him with a missing arm, a wiped memory, and a cryptic message imprinted on his subconscious. A decade of loss and desperation later, the unraveling of this message catapults him to Sidus—a galactic station where the universe's eclectic denizens trade, compete, and vie for power.</p> <p>In Sidus, notoriety comes with danger, and every enhancement is a double-edged sword. Betrayed by his species, his family dissolved, Carter Riley is the quintessential underdog turned unwilling pioneer. As the first human to interface with the legacy of an ancient race, he is thrust into the heart of the Sidus system—a game-like reality where his every move is monitored, and every level gained draws him deeper into a labyrinth of intrigue. Carter has the power to level humanity up by deciphering the legacy of an ancient civilization. Each level is more complex than the next and his very own life it's at risk, so will he want to go on for a race that betrayed him?</p> <p>The stakes couldn't be higher: decipher the past or be doomed to repeat it. Prepare for a journey where the line between player and legend blurs, in a universe where making contact has consequences beyond imagination.</p>";
