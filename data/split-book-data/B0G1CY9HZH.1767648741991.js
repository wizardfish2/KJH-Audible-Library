But dealing with the reckless—not to mention mutinous—scheme of the woman he trusts is a whole new challenge he hadn't expected.</p> <p>Left behind, without his advanced starship, Mitch has to figure out a way to track her down, get his ship back, and confront the impossibly one-sided conflict she's entangled them in. Oh, and the freedom of an entire planet hangs in the balance.</p> <p>Can Mitch navigate the dangers of alien technology, atmospheric dogfights, and guerrilla sabotage, all while sorting out his place in this far-flung star cluster? Or will a single misstep spell disaster for his intergalactic escapade?</p> <p><i>If you enjoy humorous \"Found Spaceship\" adventures with a side of witty romantic tension, then you'll love </i>She Stole My Buddy's Starship.</p>";
