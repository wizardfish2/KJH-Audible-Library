window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Path to Peace brought them to the gates of the old city. Now Alburet and his friends will need to find their way into the vaults under the city. They will need to bypass the undead and the cultists that roam the city to even find those tunnels, and that’s only the start of the troubles they will face.</p> <p>Traitors to Stormguard are uncovered, and the King will have to be told. That can only happen after they deal with the two quests that have brought them this far. Vladimir Dracon hopes to put his brother Dimitry to rest, slaying the one known as the Dragon Eater, while Sir Cody Carter has come to make sure the Urn of Souls is destroyed so it doesn’t fall into Stein’s hands.</p> <p>What happens under Peace will tilt the balance of what is to come: either in favor of the Crown of Stormguard, or for Stein and his cultists.</p> <p>Welcome back to Alpha World.</p> <p><b><i>Contains adult themes.</i></b></p>";
