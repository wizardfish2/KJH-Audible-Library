However, Keith failed to realize that this deal did not come with an expiration date, no matter how many times he died.</p> <p>After dying for the dozenth time, Keith renegotiates with the immortal. This new deal will see him sent to the world of Raiah - a world filled with monsters, cowardly monkeys, and a system of magic very similar to the fantasy roleplaying games his brother used to enjoy.</p> <p>Completing a quest to hunt the most dangerous monsters on the planet is the price Keith will need to pay to regain his old life. Itâ€™s a good thing that all of his experiences in his previous lives translate to Skills in this new one because if Keith fails this time, the price he will need to pay will be far steeper.</p> <p><i>We Hunt Monsters</i> is a crunchy LitRPG in an epic fantasy setting. Fans of Dakota Krout, Will Wight, and the Monster Hunter games will enjoy this new series by the best-selling author of the Rise to Omniscience and Buryoku series.</p>";
