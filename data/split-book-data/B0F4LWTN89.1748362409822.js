window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sometimes in life, you feel like the world is out to get you. Nothing ever seems to work out the way you want it to, and everything just goes wrong all at the same time. But you have to bear up under the weight of life and just keep swinging. It can't stay bad forever, right?</b></p> <p>That is what Casey Sullivan believed when he spent his entire young life in an orphanage, fighting for scraps and doing his best to not get shanked by the youth gangs there. When he had the opportunity to make a difference, he seized it with both hands and did everything in his power to pass the police academy.</p> <p>He succeeded, and that's what killed him in the end.</p> <p>But things couldn't be that easy. Because Casey's story doesn't end there. Something was pulling the strings the entire time behind the scenes. And when the puppet refused to dance to his tune anymore, the puppeteer tried to throw him away.</p> <p>And it is at that place—lost between worlds and powerless—where he was found, and where Casey was given the opportunity to do the one thing that he desperately wanted.</p> <p>Get revenge against the creature that toyed with his life, and ruined his death.</p> <p>Steelforged Legacy is a progression fantasy, men's romance, western cultivation story that takes heavy inspiration from classic cultivation and combines it with an alternate take on Norse mythology. Even the gods can't always see the future right, and the world it is set in takes advantage of the fact that sometimes, even the Fates can make mistakes.</p>";
