window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A mission failed... A civilization on the edge of collapse... A dangerous alliance to save it... </p> <p>Colonel Mitchell \"Ares\" Williams has never been one to accept failure. While the outcome on Liberty is a crushing setback to his and the Riggers' chances of salvaging the war, there's no time to waste on regret. After all, the mission wasn't a total loss, delivering an unexpected asset in the wake of their defeat - Liun Tio, aka the Knife, a notorious warlord and enemy of the Alliance whose deep-seated mistrust of artificial intelligence and control over what may be the largest free fleet in the galaxy have made him the most important man alive. </p> <p>If humanity is going to have a chance to survive the Tetron onslaught, Ares and the Knife will need to find a way to work together. But can the two learn to trust one another enough to bring the power of their joint forces to bear against a common enemy? Or will their fragile alliance crumble beneath the weight of personal motives and divergent goals? </p> <p>As Mitchell and the Riggers will soon discover, the knife's edge cuts both ways. </p>";
