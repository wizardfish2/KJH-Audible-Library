window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Apocalypse Game has begun, and all of humanity is up for grabs. To the victor go the spoils. </b></p> <p>My name is Killian Dunn. I'm eighteen, a high school senior, a gamer, and, oh yeah, the Harbinger of the Apocalypse. Not exactly what I had in mind as a career path. Reality took a nosedive when Armageddon came knocking. It brought with it classes, levels, and skills, as well as a horde of Lovecraftian abominations to use them on. I never wanted any of this, but the sick god who orchestrated this whole nightmare has my family. Their lives are forfeit if I refuse to play his game.</p> <p>He left me no choice but to accept my role and play my part—not as just another piece on the chessboard, but as the king—the Demon Lord of the Black. But if I'm the villain, then there must also be a hero. On the side of White stands the Archangel, and they're as determined as I am to win.</p> <p>The prize? A single wish. With it, I can protect my family, fix everything that's broken, and save the whole damn world.</p> <p>I just have to destroy it first.</p>";
