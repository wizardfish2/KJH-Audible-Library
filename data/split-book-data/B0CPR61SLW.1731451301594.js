window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After a decade as a single dad, I thought I had life figured out. I put my broken heart on the shelf to raise my daughter Maddie, and watching her grow into a confident, successful woman has been reward enough.</p> <p>Still, life has a way of throwing curves at you—the kind of curves that will get any guy’s attention.</p> <p>When Maddie’s best friends Lexie and Olivia find themselves homeless after losing their apartment, there’s no question I’m going to offer them refuge. They were there for Maddie during our darkest hours, and it’s my turn to be there for them now.</p> <p>But I’m not prepared for what they bring—what it means to be drawn to two beautiful women half my age, let alone two women who’ve been part of Maddie’s life for so long. I know the chemistry is mutual, but Lexie and Olivia have their own wounds to heal. It’s clear they need the kind of support only an experienced guy like me can give them.</p> <p>Do I dare take that step? Do I risk what it could do to Maddie, who’s been the center of my universe until now?</p> <p>As the attraction between the three of us intensifies, I have to balance what family really means against an unconventional passion that could upset everything.</p>";
