Good riddance and all, but the assassin was none other than Era's bestie and perpetual \"it's complicated,\" Liv. </p> <p>As the Empire mourns its problematic fave, Era sees his chance to put a stop to House Koschei's \"Island\" conspiracy. But when he finds what he seeks, let's just say too much truth can be a biohazard. </p> <p>As for Liv, she sets off on a desert pilgrimage to save a friend caught in the crossfire. When that goes off the rails, she's caught between a vengeful tyrant's plot and her own self-destructive brain.</p> <p>The Koscheis' tyranny extends into not only this world, but the afterlife itself. And despite it all, Era, Liv, and Noah are the only three people who stand a chance against them—if they can stop having a new mental breakdown every five vogging minutes!</p>";
