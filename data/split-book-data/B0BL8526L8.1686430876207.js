window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The story of Nate the potion maker continues!</b></p> <p>Well, did you know that Kyushu is an F-ranked town? Neither did I, but had I known about this tidbit of information, all of the unfortunate attacks would’ve made sense. I think. But the Lord Ruler truly is a douche canoe for leaving his people to fend for themselves.</p> <p>That’s not all. My shop’s ranking is E, embarrassing really, despite all of the hard work put into building it.</p> <p>There’s a lot of work to do to be competitive with the other shops out there. But the most important things are training my apprentices, getting to know my betrothed, understanding my pets, and welcoming our new farmhand.</p> <p>Will I ever be confident enough to truly feel like a master of apprentices? Who knows?</p> <p>The story begins with picking up my third apprentice from a mother who may have too much ambition and enough anger issues to give even Meredith Blake a run for her money.</p> <p>Novel contains: strong MC in a slice-of-life environment, dungeon diving, boss battles, cultivation and elements, mana/magic, MC-exclusive system but it doesn't do the work for him, treasures, adventurers, slow world building, build-up, features that will not be introduced all at once (upgrades so on), actual good loot at the end of very powerful bosses, romance (no harem). As characters develop throughout the series, issues and emotions and even the MC may find himself in a corner or two. A story of an upcoming potion shopkeeper and his apprentices.</p> <p>Building an S-ranked potion shop is easier said than done....</p> <p>Edited by Adam Luopa</p> <p>Cover art by Shirasiyuki</p>";
