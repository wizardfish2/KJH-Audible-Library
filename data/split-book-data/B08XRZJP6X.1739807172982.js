Akin to a god. The path to their survival. </p> <p>Only, he isn't. Not by a long shot. </p> <p>He is their greatest enemy, hidden within their midst. The most dangerous threat of all. </p> <p>No one sees him for who he is, but her. The one whose very existence is a guaranteed death sentence, should she be discovered. Worse, she is a twin, and the chieftain has forbidden all twins. If she is revealed, her brother will die too. </p> <p>But Anira is the only one who realizes who the chieftain really is. </p> <p>She must decide what is more important: her own survival and that of her twin, or that of her entire people and the dragons they are sworn to protect. </p> <p>When a baby dragon, left for dead, is the first to ever see her, it's up to the two of them to do what must be done. </p> <p>** The Dragon Force series is an action-packed, magical adventure suitable for listeners of all ages. **</p>";
