He returns to his ancestral manor and is greeted by crumbling walls, growing debts, and a father who’s conveniently disappeared. To top it all off, someone is intent on making his new role as lord of the estate as difficult as possible.</p> <p>Armed with magic and a purpose, Julian must juggle the ancient art of estate management. Luckily, he's not alone. Julian's joined by an old sweetheart, who happens to be a bashful water mage with immense power and a kitsune archer with a sharp tongue that's only matched by her deadly aim. With both ladies at his side, there are whispers of a new Arcane Lord. To save the estate financial issues, they hunt for a treasure that everyone seems to want, but no one can find.</p> <p>As they unravel the mysteries piling up faster than his father’s unpaid bills, Julian learns that being a lord might just be the ultimate adventure, especially when your allies are as magical and wondrous as your enemies are menacing.</p>";
