window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“What’s the point of having magical powers if we don’t use ’em to help people?”</b></p> <p>Forged in the fires of the lawless wasteland, Clay, Alex, and Joe have finally earned the unimaginable power of Incants. All they want now is to settle down, drink a few beers, and carve out a new life west of the containment wall.</p> <p>Not everyone in the IZ has such noble goals at heart, however. When the Jaeger Squad learns that another group of magic-slinging Incants are enslaving homesteaders to farm gold and harvest enchanted items to sell on the black market, they can’t just turn a blind eye. Especially since Clay and the others are the only ones with the power to make things right.</p> <p>But the Jaegers might have picked a fight too big for their newfound abilities. These Incants have had years to level up and fortify their LA stronghold. Unless the crew can unlock the dark secrets of an ancient order of eccentric monks, their dream of a new life in the wasteland might turn into a waking nightmare.</p> <p><i>From best-selling authors Eden Hudson and James Hunter comes a whole new adventure inside their Rogue Dungeon Universe. Buy now to continue your journey.</i></p>";
