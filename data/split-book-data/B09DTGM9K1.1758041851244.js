He and his growing family had just moved into a new home and hired on new staff for day-to-day matters. All he wanted to do was craft and love his wives, and it seemed like the peaceful life he hoped for might be within his reach. </p> <p>Denmur and Lord Sharpeyes would not let that happen. Using their connections, they put into motion a chain of events that would reverberate across the city of Hearthglen. Sean was called to attend the Lord’s party - he came, bringing all of his family and friends with him. </p> <p>Both sides were surprised by events as they unfolded, and it quickly became apparent that conflict would not be denied. With the Einherjar, a Valkyrie, and an old foe, Velin Dykstra, backing them up, Evan Sharpeyes and Klein Denmur challenged Sean to trial by combat. </p> <p>Exhausted and with depleted energy, Sean still led his wives onto the field of battle. The fight was bloody and taxing, but in the end, Sean struck down Evan Sharpeyes before collapsing. With his eyesight fading, Sean looked at his wives, but only saw a few female-like figures rushing toward him. The last sound he heard was a great many wings converging on him, and his mind drifted to thoughts of Morrigan.... </p> <p>Word of Sean’s victory spread throughout the city, but none could say whether he had survived to enjoy it. </p> <p>(This work contains adult situations that some might find offensive, the least of which is graphic sex. This book is about an Overpowered MC, and contains a harem. You’ve been warned.)</p>";
