window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A war of magic. A legend of three elves. Darkness threatening to return.</b></p> <p>Elves were supposed to be gone, defeated in the great war. Magic is practiced behind closed doors, and only by the elites. All I was trying to do was survive, maybe with a bit more curiosity about my master's magic than I should've allowed. He caught me snooping, and sent me on a quest to steal a magic scroll. A quest that would change my life.</p> <p>Soon, I found myself caught up in a whirlwind journey that involved elves, monsters, and more than one hottie in my bed.</p> <p>I was terrified. I was challenged. I was pleasured beyond belief.</p> <p>I was loving every second of it, and now get to share that journey with you.</p> <p>Warning: Harem elements, though more so in Books 2 and 3. The spicy sort, with detail.</p>";
