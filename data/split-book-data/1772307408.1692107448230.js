window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eric knows it's not easy, being King. Fortunately, he has a Queen for that.</p> <p>Eric - or King Halar, or Vlad, or any number of aliases - doesn't want to be bothered. It's hard to pin down what he does want, if anything. He lives a quiet life, almost a solitary one, mourning in his own way for the loss of someone dear.</p> <p>His quiet solitude can't go on forever. Despite the empty places inside him, events and creatures move through the worlds and across the void between, forcing him into action, into fighting, into confronting things perhaps better left alone...even forcing him into being a King.</p>";
