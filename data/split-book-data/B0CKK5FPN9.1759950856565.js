And even worse, it's with the Heroes of Earth, one of the biggest hero orgs in the world! Apparently, they have some concerns about me founding a new evil organization. Just because I have a home death ray, an evil lair, and a trio of gorgeous villainess lovers, not to mention a demoness who's taking a vacation in my house.</p> <p>And I really don't have time to deal with heroes. Because a group of mad scientists called the Brain Trust are after my psychic villainess, all to power a machine to either take over the world, or ensure everyone flosses.</p> <p>Just another day as a Villain for Hire.</p>";
