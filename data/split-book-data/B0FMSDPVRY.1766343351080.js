I have decided to travel south to the ruins of an old Army base to rescue a few survivors there. One of them, a beautiful woman named Iris, helped us out with something special:</p> <p><b>Her melons.</b></p> <p>That's right, our gardens were finally starting to grow! Iris had seeds, and our friends from Loch Raven brought some as well. Once spring rolled around we'd have more food than we knew knew what to do with. But with the new survivors here, I'm reminded that we needed to focus on certain things:</p> <p><b>Big jugs.</b></p> <p>Because no one had indoor plumbing yet. We still had to haul five-gallon jugs of water from the lake to our houses. Yet another thing to fix, but we're getting there. In fact, the whole settlement was really starting to come together. Things were about as good as could be, especially since now I had to learn how to handle three more things: beautiful women.</p>";
