Now it's time for payback.</b><br> <br> While they were guarding against one kidnapping spree, the Veil performed another. But Scarlett has a lead on the captives, and for once, she's going to be the one delivering trouble rather than receiving it. The Veil won't be stopped by just one strike, though. Camus' plans to control captives and their owners with magical mind control collars could make him unstoppable. All he needs to do is get the collars on, place the servants, and activate the magic inside them.<br> <br> <b>Time is ticking away while Scarlett, The Witches on Wheels, and the Spell Riders search for the key lead.</b><br> <br> Scarlett may need a new kind of magic to beat the Veil this time. An elderly witch wants to teach her how to use blood magic to track someone. Is it enough? And does it pose its own threat?<br> <br> Meanwhile, Maddox and Amber will collaborate on getting Dusk Runner ready for battle. And Rath the troll will teach her to be better at throwing knives, in accordance with his mantra, \"Must Train.\"<br> <br> <b>But will anything be enough to root out the Veil's location so they can finally destroy the group?</b><br> <br> Only one way to find out.</p>";
