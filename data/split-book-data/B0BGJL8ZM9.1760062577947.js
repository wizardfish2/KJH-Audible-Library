Catastrophically so.

In fact, it happened all around the world.</p> <p>Few places were spared, though, only a handful experienced it as deeply as the United States did.</p> <p>In the Wastes of the world, every fantasy creature, fairy tale demon, or mythological monster exists. From Orcs, to Neriads, Ogres, Trolls, Wraiths, Elves, Harpies, and even Beastmen. They all exist, and all despise humankind.</p> <p>For North America, in the shattered bones of the country, the West and East Coasts, new governments have rose, then fell.</p> <p>Vince has become the master of a major portion of the Wastes of North America. Responsible for everything and everyone inside his boundaries.
