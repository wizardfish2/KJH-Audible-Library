window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When legends come to life, the world trembles from a single name. Ronin. Once-heroes from a different age, they wield elemental powers: wind, water, fire, stone, forest, sun, moon, flesh, and metal.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the same time, a young man discovers his best friend with a sword in her stomach and dark wings sprouting from her back. Guards rush to the scene and accuse him of the act, and he is forced to flee.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a new world without his memories, Gray must find his way amid legends and darkness, as he wrestles with an elemental power inside himself. A power all too similar to the infamous Ronin.</p>";
