An uppity wizard cartel is creeping into my business. If that's not enough, I keep seeing the same damn black cat everywhere I go. Talk about crummy luck. </p> <p>None of it matters. I've got laser focus on my archenemy, a jinn with a knack for fire. News flash: I'm done being burned. Connor Hatch is going down for good, even if I have to drag him to hell myself. </p>";
