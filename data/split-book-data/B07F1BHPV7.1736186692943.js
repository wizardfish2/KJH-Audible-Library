A thief is becoming a thorn in Gunnar's side, and a tempting elf is getting a little feisty.</p> <p>In order to protect their village, the members of Unity will need to work together to level up and find better gear. They'll need to lay the foundation of a castle that can serve as a fortification from intruders.</p> <p>But what if there's a better way?</p> <p>When Gunnar learns the king of Highcastle will grant an audience to anyone who wins an arena championship, he decides to enter the competition as a gladiator. If he can earn a meeting with the ailing king and persuade him to stop Dryden before his dragon flies, he can save Edgewood and countless lives. He'll also get his name posted in every arena, which could lead Rachel one step closer to finding him.</p> <p>The arena is a spectacle where people gather to watch fighters put their skills to the test, earn fame, and take home gold. Does Gunnar have what it takes to become a champion, or has he bitten off more than he can chew?</p>";
