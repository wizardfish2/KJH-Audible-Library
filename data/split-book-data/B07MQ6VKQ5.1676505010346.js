The routine of studies, sports, duties...these all help her adjust - so do having friends and helping others. Of course, her life can't be that simple.</p> <p>While the alliance between supernaturals and the government has proven itself, with the terrorists reluctant to attack and risk yet another failure, Missy is now being watched by enemy agents. They believe she is a demon! Will they learn enough to target the US once again?</p> <p>And, what about that spy the terrorists have working in Congress? Perhaps it's time for Missy to stop hiding what she can do. After all, such things can't be proven, and the world won't ever believe them, so let the enemy beware!</p>";
