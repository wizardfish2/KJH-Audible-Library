window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ye screw with this lass, ye get put on yer ass.</p> <p>Some days I kick life in the ass. Other days it kicks back.</p> <p>On a good day, wearing the Fianna mark tosses me into topsy-turvy trials. It's a scramble but I manage to hold it together with the help of amazing family and friends: mythical, magical, and mortal. But despite best-laid plans, collateral damage occurs.</p> <p>I can live with me getting hurt but watching someone I love suffer - not so much. Is there any limit to where I'd go or who I'd face off against? No. There isn't.</p> <p>On a quest to save life and love, and with no time to spare, I take on a world of dragons, gnomes, witches, and trolls. Out of my depths and against a power that can snap me like a twig, there's only one thing I know for sure.... Failure is not an option.</p> <p>Fiona continues her journey to becoming the druid she's destined to be in this sixth installment of the Chronicles of the Urban Druid. Don't miss a moment of this rollicking ride.</p>";
