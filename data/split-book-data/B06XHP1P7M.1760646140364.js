But is a date of significance throughout history. </p> <p>On 9/11, nine A.D., three Roman legions were annihilated by an alliance of Germanic tribes; the Romans would never again attempt to expand east of the Rhine River. </p> <p>On 9/11, 1973, a military coup in Chile, engineered by the United States, toppled the elected President and eventually brought Pinochet to power. </p> <p>On 9/11, 1857, over 100 emigrants were slaughtered in the Mountain Meadows Massacre in Utah. </p> <p>On 9/11, 2001, over 3,000 Americans were killed in the word terrorist attack in our history. </p> <p>All of these events, and others on the same day, are being manipulated by the Shadow in an attempt to change our history. It is up to the Time Patrol to send an agent back to six different years on 9/11 and make sure our timeline remains intact. If they fail, our present will snap out of existence! </p>";
