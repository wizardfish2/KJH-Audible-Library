window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Captain Jason Burke has begun to suspect that the random attacks on his ship and crew over the last couple of years may not be so random after all. Evidence is mounting that there is something on the <i>Phoenix</i>...something that powerful factions will stop at nothing to get their hands on. While Omega Force races to find out what is hidden on their ship that is causing so much trouble they also must figure out why such powerful enemies bent on obtaining it. They'll need to rely on old allies, and a few old adversaries, to unravel the mystery that's been hovering over them since they first stole the gunship from the treacherous Deetz so long ago. The crew is used to fighting long odds, but will they be prepared to sacrifice everything to keep the <i>Phoenix</i>'s secret from falling into the wrong hands? </p>";
