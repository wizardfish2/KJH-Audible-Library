window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Humanity to save. Alien threats to annihilate. Aim your spells accordingly.</b></p> <p>Drew and his team are the entire counter-offensive plan against the Naga. He knows that the serpents must be dealt with, but watching the Sidhe forces take the nodes near his old home, and turn them violet, is weighing on him. Even worse than the external threat is the pressing fact that the gathered humans are beginning to fracture into factions with competing desires.</p> <p>The mana shield over the stadium was supposed to solve every one of their problems. The Naga disagreed, and their frequent skirmishes are ramping up into a constant drain on resources. Drewâ€™s only possible response to the humans, the aliens, and the strange, urban jungle appearing across the Potomac is to increase the count of his own red nodes and build up his strength; all in a race to save humanity.</p> <p>As tensions rise, Drew wonders more and more if he can solve everything with a well-placed fireball.</p>";
