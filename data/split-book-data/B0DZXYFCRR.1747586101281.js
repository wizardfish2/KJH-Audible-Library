Able to bring ideas, technology, and magic with them as they travel, each Thresholder has an oversized impact on the world they're in, each one attempting to shape and change it to their will. Some, like Perry, try to uplift the world and improve everyone's circumstances, while others are interested only in gaining advantages for themselves.</p> <p>Why should Perry leave his mark on one world, when he can leave it on all of them?</p>";
