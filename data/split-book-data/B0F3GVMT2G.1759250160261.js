window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tristan must flee south, away from the battle against the Arctic Lindworm’s Skada. Behind him the battle for the Iron Duchy, Ahead the Meadow Duchy, with a fleeting promise of sanctuary, for those now forced to wander.</p> <p>They are refugees, scattered amongst the tide of fate.</p> <p>But the Lindworm’s rage has unleashed more than destruction. From their mountain home the goblins spill, a plague, their forms twisted by a new darkness, corrupted and made worse by something older, something strange.</p> <p>What was horrible before is now grotesque, a twisted threat rending mind and soul.</p> <p>Sanctuary doesn’t come free. Credits must be spent, blood must be spilled. The ground they seek to claim may offer rest, but only after it has tasted enough violence to be sated. Peace, if it can be found at all, will be bought at a steep price.</p>";
