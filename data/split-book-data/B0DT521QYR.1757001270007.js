window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Davik of Darkshire thought he’d found peace in Oakshire—until a deadly mage shattered that calm. After racing for answers and finding none, the group tries to settle back into their routine at the tavern.</p> <p>But as winter fades, secrets—both old and new—begin to surface. One of them belongs to Tyra.</p> <p>Her faen birthright is being auctioned off in the shadows of an outlawed festival. Without it, she’ll never heal the wounds of her past or build the future she longs to create. The group knows the dangers that lie ahead in Hollyhead, but they can’t let Tyra face them alone.</p> <p>As Davik helps Tyra prepare to confront her past, their connection deepens, pulling him into a struggle between friendship and something more. But their journey is fraught with risks.</p> <p>Sariel dons the armor she swore to abandon, determined to protect them all. Elina pushes her divine powers to their limits, while Vorga understands that Tyra’s heritage holds the key to the closure she truly needs. Yet as they strive to stay united, Karley's growing distance leaves the group vulnerable to unseen dangers.</p> <p>With the secret Floraison auction looming, Davik leads them into a land where Tyra once fled a life of serfdom—and where the fires of Rochdale, the city Davik failed to defend, still burn in his memory. Nobles in masks, forbidden wine, and old enemies lie in wait.</p>";
