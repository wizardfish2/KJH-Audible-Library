window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A zero-turned-hero must battle his way across a perilous landscape of monsters, magic, and mayhem in the third book of a hilarious fantasy-adventure series.</b></p> <p>In the magical world of Regaia, ultra-yoked orc warrior Loon (formerly loser Earthling Gabe Skelter) has rampaged across the land, gaining perks, skills, awesome powers, and an oddball crew of allies. Now, against all hope, he's found his fellow \"sojourners\"—classmates of Gabe's who were also transported to this dangerous realm, each taking up their own new forms. Of course, some of them are still major asshats, but that's just the start of Loon's problems.</p> <p>Because not only are the sojourners under constant threat from Regaia's wide assortment of nightmarish creatures, fearsome foes, and bloodthirsty armies of all stripes. They now also face the cold, hard reality of building a solid settlement for themselves before the coming winter. You know, the makings of basic survival: food, water, shelter, etc. Luckily for Loon and company, there's a simple fix.</p> <p>It's a very special treasure called a Prosperity Conduit, a mythical talisman that could boost their small, fragile community into a thriving society and ensure their continued success and achievement. There's only one teensy, tiny problem . . . They'll have to kill a god to get it.</p> <p>Bursting with battle, bloodshed, and the bullheaded brashness of youth, <i>Big Sneaky Barbarian 3</i> is a guaranteed pleaser for fans of quick wit, RPG action, and plot twists that just won't quit.</p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 100,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
