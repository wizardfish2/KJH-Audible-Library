But surviving in one of the world's top battle academies isn't the only thing they have to worry about. Fellow students, rivals, beautiful girls, and treacherous exams stand in the way of their first steps on the path of ascension. </p> <p><i>Wyvern Academy is a harem cultivation series inspired by Japanese Light Novels as well as a deep love and respect for anime, kung fu, martial arts, and battle academy adventures. It contains some explicit adult content, unconventional relationships, and violence.</i></p>";
