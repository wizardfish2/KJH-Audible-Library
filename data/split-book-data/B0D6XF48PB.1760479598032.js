Though arcstone, the material that powered most of the world’s devices, could only be found in the dungeon, they still had plenty on hand. The doors would open again, surely.</p> <p>Then the anomalies began to appear. Snatching up people, never to be seen again.</p> <p>This was the world Phineas Lenville was born into thirty years later. Clockwork contraptions powered by steam and the rapidly dwindling supply of arcstone, with the few intrepid individuals striving to bring back the golden age where inventors were cherished and respected.</p> <p>Phin’s greatest desire was to be one of those inventors. So much more respectable than being a simple tinker. One day…</p> <p>When one of the anomalies pulled him in, he thought it was the end. But he survived. Deposited in a strange town, separated from all other civilization by unending miles of monster-infested wilderness and with no escape, his first emotion was despair.</p> <p>Until a sweet, beautiful voice and the angelic woman it belonged to welcomed him, showed him kindness he’d rarely experienced before. Grace Chandler was enough to make him forget about all his troubles.</p> <p><b>Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad in this new place.</b></p>";
