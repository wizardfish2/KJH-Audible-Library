There were no flashes of lightning or anything like that. But there had been a lot of wind the moment before. Unlike a moment before, I wasn’t alone, and I wasn’t in my hotel room overlooking the ocean.</p><p>Scattered around me were the bodies of twenty men. At the front of the large stone room were four more men, very much alive, and a woman screaming.</p><p>Rushing at them, I reached them just as one of the men was about to strike the woman in the face. In that instant, all of the restraints of normal training sessions were lifted, and all the rules of the dojo left me.
