window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There is one rule: join the Hunt or become the hunted…</b></p> <p>Boyd Knight, Marine turned Vigil, has been formally invited to join the Wyld Hunt. To refuse is a death sentence. Participating might not be any safer.</p> <p>As the Caller of the Hunt, it is up to the Queen of Oblivion to select targets worthy of the wrath of the Fae Court. Hunters from across the Wylds are unleashed like hounds to track down each target and exact bloody vengeance against those who have struck dark deals for money, fame, and power. But nothing is ever as straightforward as it seems, and cheating, murder, and treachery are all just a part of the rules of decorum when it comes to the Hunt.</p> <p>Can Boyd navigate the perilous politics of the Fae Courts and survive the murderous, inhuman nobles looking for any excuse to execute him?</p> <p>From James A. Hunter—bestselling author of Rogue Dungeon, and the Completionist Chronicles Expanded Universe—comes a shoot-'em-up LitRPG fantasy series brimming with spells, upgrades, guns, and monsters!</p>";
