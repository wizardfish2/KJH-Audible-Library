window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this new Laundry Files adventure the fate of the world will literally depend on the roll of dice... twenty-sided dice, that is.</p> <p>In 1984, Derek Reilly was just another spotty teenage dungeon master growing up in middle England. But then a secret government agency tasked with suppressing magical intrusions received a tip-off—and one midnight raid later, his life was turned upside down by the Satanic D&amp;D Panic.</p> <p>Decades later Derek, now middle-aged and institutionalized, is a long-term inmate at Camp Sunshine, a center for deprogramming captured Elder God cultists. He's considered safe enough to edit the camp newsletter, and he even has postal privileges—which he uses to run a play-by-mail game. After 25 years, Derek finally has reason to escape: a nearby D&amp;D convention. While Derek's D&amp;D games were full of fictional elder gods and world-ending threats, a LARP game at the con is a dread ritual designed to summon a great evil into our world, and it's up to Derek and his players to stop them.</p> <p>The fate of the world may depend on the contents of Derek's magic dice bag.</p>";
