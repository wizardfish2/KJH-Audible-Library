Between murderous cults, power-hunger adventurers, and now a missing cornerstone, I’ve had my work cut out for me.</p> <p>Finding what was stolen will require me to delve deep into the secrets of my hometown, including the enigmatic Order of Stone. But with a spidery scholar, a talented blacksmith, and my ghostly familiar by my side, we’ll get to the bottom of the mystery. Heck, I might even find time to take my newest resident—an ice-cold dryad—out on a date.</p> <p>Dire schemes are underway, threatening not just my lair but all of Ashling Grove. Only by unraveling the cursed history of my lair will I stand a chance of stopping them in time.</p> <p>Do wizards who purchase condos have to put up with this kind of crap?</p>";
