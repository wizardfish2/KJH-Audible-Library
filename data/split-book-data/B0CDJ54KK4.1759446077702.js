You're in for a fiery ride.</p> <p>Since freeing our elemental powers, my siblings and I have been attacked, threatened, heckled, and told our entire life has been a massive magical cover-up.</p> <p>We are orphans of the decimated elemental kingdoms of the Fae Realm.</p> <p>The learning curve of our new lives has been butt-kickingly steep and all the things I thought I knew for sure . . . I didn't.</p> <p>Seelie warriors, amorous trolls, hellhounds, and a hunky fire guy with too many secrets.</p> <p>How's a girl to find her footing?</p> <p>When push comes to shove, the Quebec Quint is greater than the sum of its parts.
