window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Boyd has mixed views on luck. Sure, Earth died more than a thousand years ago. Luckily, humanity found and was able to reach a new habitable planet. Sure, the new planet was filled with hostile and superpowered flora and fauna that tried to wipe the new settlers out. Luckily the first generation born on the new planet developed Powers of their own. Sure, the first hundred or so years on their new planet were a constant struggle for survival. Luckily, humanity was able to band together and form cities to survive.</p> <p>Now, a thousand years later, his own luck is as much of a mixed bag as the rest of humanity. He was lucky enough to be one of the few born Powered. Luckier still, his Powers made him stronger than most.</p> <p>Unluckily, he is also a Changed, those unfortunate enough to mutate during puberty into something like the creatures that appeared in Old Earth's myths and legends. Unluckier still, he didn't become an angel or fairy. Not even a satyr or something else moderately acceptable. Boyd looks like a demon, and the unfortunate fact of the matter is that Changed have a tendency to behave how they look.</p> <p>With his Change, he was forced to reevaluate his life goals. Gone were any plans to become one of The Authority's Heroes, those who kept humanity safe from Powered Criminals and the creatures that threaten their cities from the Wild Lands. No one wants a Hero that looks like a demon for fear that they'll start acting like one at an inconvenient time.</p> <p>Who would want him around their children, even if he means only to save them? If not for the fortunate, if poorly timed, discovery of his most useful and rare Power, The Authority would have likely dismissed him. He represents a PR nightmare after all.</p> <p>Boyd is an Enhancer, a Powered capable of improving the Powers of others. Each one has had their own rules on who they can Enhance and how they do it. Each also has a cost to the Enhanced associated with it. Again, this is a mixed bag on the luck front as far as Boyd is concerned. The rules associated with his Enhancements aren't so bad, itâ€™s the cost he takes issue with.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Boyd, The Authority that raised and trained him in one of their Powered Adolescent Centers as well as the love of his life are both dead set on him using his Power as freely as possible. The adored and lovable Silver, or Silvie to Boyd, is more than willing to manipulate him into getting it done when The Authority's orders fail.</p> <p>Join Boyd as he takes the first steps down the road of building the strongest Hero Team humanity has ever known. Whether he wants to or not.</p>";
