Little did I know how much deeper the rabbit hole could go.</p> <p>When I was offered a job to hunt down and stop a group of flamboyant assassins, I immediately said what any self-respecting poker player would say: No. No way. Absolutely not. Are you out of your mind?</p> <p>What's that? Four hundred <i>thousand</i>? Nah. Can't spend it if you're dead.</p> <p>Say that again? You're offering me <i>what</i>?</p> <p>I tried to hold out, folks. I really did. But every man has his price, so Cougs, Ruse, Kahni, and I found ourselves on the road toward the city of my dreams, and the absolute <i>last</i> place I should <i>ever</i> go.</p> <p>Viva Las Vegas!</p> <p><b>Warning: This book has adult themes, including a slow-burn harem and violence.</b></p>";
