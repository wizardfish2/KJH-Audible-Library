window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sam may be the Iblis, but she is also an imp with a price on her head. The powerful demon, Haagenti, won't rest until she's dragged back to Hel for \"punishment\". Sam knows she can't face Haagenti and win, so when an Elf Lord offers to eliminate the demon in return for her help, Sam jumps at the chance. It's a simple job - find and retrieve a half-breed monster dead or alive. But finding this demon/elf hybrid isn't proving easy and time is running out. </p>";
