You'll learn things that most people can only dream of. You'll make swords with self-sharpening blades, bows that fire by themselves, and clocks that can read the future.</p> <p>Even better, you'll get to live in the sunlit village of Sunhampton, a sleepy little crafter's village of cobbled streets, cozy taverns, and pleasant bakeries.</p> <p>If this sounds like just the life for you, then grab a beer and a sweet roll, and follow Lewis as he begins his new life as an apprentice.</p> <p>Lewis comes from a family who don't regard him much, so he sets out on his own into the world, intent on securing an apprenticeship in an interesting profession. What he doesn't expect is to find himself studying one of the most mystical arts in the land.</p> <p>It'll be hard work. Perhaps even dangerous work. But with an old artificery master to teach him, and the friends that he makes to help him, he's sure he'll get there.</p> <p>Why not get yourself over to the cozy town of Sunhampton and join him on his quest?</p>";
