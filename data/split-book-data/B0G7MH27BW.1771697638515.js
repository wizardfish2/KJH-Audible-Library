But everything changes when he undergoes the Mantle Trial—a test which could grant him the power to step into the Dungeon as one of the elite instead of their Mundane servant.</p> <p>Yet power comes with a price. The world of Adventurers is darker, bloodier, and far more treacherous than Atlas ever imagined. Monsters and Gods lurk not only in the depths, but in the ambitions of those who call themselves allies.</p> <p><b>Can Atlas carve a place for himself in this ruthless world—or will he be swallowed whole, just another forgotten name among the fallen?</b></p>";
