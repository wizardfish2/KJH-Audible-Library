I’m dropped in the middle of a new world as a dragon with jet-black scales and obsidian flames to match.</p> <p>Luckily, I still have my human form, because the locals weren't happy to see me.</p> <p>Thankfully, one was a sweet fox girl who loves to daydream. Together we hunt to survive, build ourselves a shelter, and fight some dragon slayers—even recruit a cute battle-elf.</p> <p>While living the cozy cabin life and having the occasional battle to the death with the locals, another dragon plagues the kingdom. He’s out for blood, not just mine, but the world’s.</p> <p>And he’s got allies of his own.</p> <p>I’m building our cabin in a sprawling field next to a sparkling lake. I won’t let the Red Dawn ruin our dream. All I want is to live in peace, and it seems I’m not the only one… Infinitely!</p>";
