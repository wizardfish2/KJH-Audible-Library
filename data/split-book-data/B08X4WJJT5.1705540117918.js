window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cut class. Kick ass. Save the friggin world.</p> <p>When college sophomore Dan Marshall's life morphs into a hybrid of Penn State and a homebrew tabletop RPG adventure, he grabs his talking two-handed sword and hits campus, seeking gold, girls, and glory.</p> <p>But even with two beautiful bad-ass women at his side, how can a low-level barbarian survive when heâ€™s pitted against a fraternity of gnolls, a dungeon full of nightmares, and an apocalyptic death cult bent on destroying the whole world?</p> <p>This compilation edition chronicles Dan's epic rise to power and includes all four previously-published books in the complete series: <i>Dan the Barbarian</i>, <i>Dan the Adventurer</i>, <i>Dan the Destroyer</i>, and <i>Dan the Warlord</i>. To prevent spoilers, the above description covers only the first book.</p> <p>Warning: This over-the-top adventure series contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, and a foul-mouthed two-handed sword. Listen at your own risk.</p>";
