window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>On his way to death row, torn into a galaxy of supers, told the fate of the universe is on his hands. </b>&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the story of Breaker. The first four books included in this boxset, along with a bonus.&nbsp;</p> <p>Who in their right mind tells both his lawyer and the judge presiding over his murder trial, “F--k you!” while still in the courtroom? No one, right? Yeah, you’d be wrong about that. I did.&nbsp;</p> <p>You’d say the same thing if you were just found guilty of a murder you didn’t commit, though. Call me crazy for going off like that in court, but trust me, you don’t know crazy until you see what happened next.&nbsp;</p> <p>I never believed in superheroes. I certainly didn’t believe that I’d become one, or that strategically forming a harem of hot ladies and getting down with them to unlock my superpowers would be the key to my survival.&nbsp;</p> <p>Did I say my survival? I meant the universe’s. No, really...that’s exactly what happened when I was taken to a galaxy of supers, thrown into a prison ship full of villains, and told it was up to me to stop them all.&nbsp;</p> <p>Read on, friend, because it gets a whole hell of a lot crazier from here.&nbsp;</p> <p>This boxset contains the following:&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Supers: Ex Heroes 1 </i></p> <p><i>Supers: Ex Heroes 2 </i></p> <p><i>Supers: Ex Heroes 3 </i></p> <p><i>Supers: Ex Heroes 4</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>Plus a bonus!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>WARNING: This book contains violence and many sexual situations, a harem, heads exploding, and ample blood. You might cringe, you will laugh, and hell, you might even cry. All of that is on purpose, I assure you. Second Edition for even better ball jokes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
