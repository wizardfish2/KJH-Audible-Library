Pirin, heir to the throne, should’ve had every advantage in life, but he is an Embercore—a magical cripple. His arcane techniques and psychic bloodline abilities are more likely to blow up in his face than work properly. No matter what, he’ll always be a step behind.</p> <p>But unstable magic can be the most devastating if used just right. Armed with nothing but stubborn determination, he sets out into foreign lands to fix his soul, find an animal familiar, and push the absolute limits of his unstable abilities. But the pursuit of magic is a deadly game, and his entire kingdom is on the line. One man might not make a difference, but a mage can. Especially a mage with mind-bending, unstable abilities. He’ll show the world the true power of an Embercore—and why they should have never underestimated him.</p> <p>About the series: Embercore is a slow-burn western cultivation novel with immersive worldbuilding, animal companions, enormous battles, and satisfying power-ups. Follow an underdog’s rise to the top as he turns disadvantages into strengths, forms alliances, and claims his throne.</p>";
