I've seen what a dragon can do, and a young, just-hatched dragon is a being of pure destruction.</p> <p>But word of the egg gets out, and the race to find it begins. Mages from many realms are on the hunt - including a dragon - and they don't always play well together. Unless I want to join the casualties, I need to find that egg and return it to where it belongs. Luckily, I have help, but I wish that damned golden-winged Nephilim would keep his shirt on.</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
