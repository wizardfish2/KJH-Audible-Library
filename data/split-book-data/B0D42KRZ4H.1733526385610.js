Here, warplanes aren’t the only thing in the sky. Oh, and my mind has a tendency to see what others are thinking.</p> <p>Now, amongst airships, beautiful beastkin, floating continents and telepathic powers, I’ll have to pick a side to fight for.</p> <p>When I do, I'll have to prove my loyalty, my skill, and play my part in saving this world from an evil that crossed from my world into this one.</p> <p>On the ground, I’m just a man, but in the air, I’m as powerful as a dragon. Fortunately, the beautiful fox, wolf, and lion girls of Dione don't just need me in battle, they need me in their beds too.</p> <p>All is fair in love and war.</p> <p><b>I’ll fly any plane, pat any head, and develop my skills as a minder, all while sniffing out spies as I work my way to a hundred kills.</b></p>";
