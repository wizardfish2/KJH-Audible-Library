But when a call comes in from the so-called \"Halfbreed Heights\", the monsterfolk part of the city, Arthur's life gets flip-turned upside down.</p> <p>Though he saved the life of a matronly lamia that day, he was also partially crippled and forced into early retirement. Now unable to fit the image of her personal superman, Arthur's wife divorces him and leaves him to move into a cheaper home in the same monsterfolk slum that caused his current situation.</p> <p>To satisfy his daughter's anxiety, he reluctantly agrees to take on a caregiver from the monsterfolk-run service, Maid For You. The twist? She's the serpentfolk daughter of the woman whose life he saved. It ends up being the best decision he's ever made.</p>";
