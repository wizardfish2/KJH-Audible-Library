That, however, was not meant to be. A single choice changed his fate, and his soul was forced to live again as a dungeon. Reborn but shackled to the heart of a mountain. This old soul has lost everything - and more.</p> <p>In a world of gods and demons, there is no room for a weak newborn dungeon. Now with a new name, Smit and his creations will have to carve out their own place. The path may be long and dangerous, but with a soul hardier than stone and a will stronger than iron, will he be able to forge his own destiny?</p> <p>â€œDebut author David Sanchez-Ponton knocks it out of the park with a brand-new Dungeon Core Novel that is sure to be up there with the likes of Divine Dungeon, Rogue Dungeon, and Bone Dungeon. Give this one a read - you won't regret it for a second!\" (James A. Hunter, best-selling author of<i> Rogue Dungeon</i>, <i>Bibliomancer</i>, and <i>Viridian Gate Online</i>.)</p>";
