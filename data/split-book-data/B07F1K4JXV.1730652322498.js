So why did she answer Sloan’s best friend’s phone? When Sloan reaches Adrianne Marx’s apartment to investigate, all she finds is a half-written list of things to do before Sloan’s wedding: </p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Order booze for the reception.</li> <li>Send the final guest count to the caterer.</li> <li>Register for gifts.</li> <li>Don’t forget to - </li> </ol> <p>That's where the to-do list ended. Mid-sentence with a scrawled line like Adrianne had been dragged away from the task. If Kasyade was involved in the abduction, Adrianne probably had been. </p> <p>The reason? Ransom. </p> <p>The price? Sloan’s unborn daughter, the most powerful angel in all of history. </p> <p>But hell can’t rival the fury of an angry mother protecting her child, and until the baby is born, her incredible power is Sloan’s to wield. Now the prey becomes the predator as Sloan seeks to put an end to Kasyade forever.</p>";
