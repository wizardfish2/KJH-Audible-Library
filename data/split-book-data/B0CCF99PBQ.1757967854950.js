Sure, humans may not like dealing with a face like mine, but hey not like youâ€™ve got many options here in the wastes.</p> <p>But one day in the middle of my route, I come upon a new job and maybe the opportunity to start thriving instead of surviving.</p> <p><i>Deadman </i>is a <i>Fallout</i>-inspired apocalyptic LitRPG about a courier braving the irradiated wasteland.
