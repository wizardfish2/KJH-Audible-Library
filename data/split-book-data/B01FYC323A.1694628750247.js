window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Science to build a starship. Wizardry to take it past light speed. A crew to give it a soul. </p> <p>The Mobius is a cobbled-together ship with a matching crew. Captain Carl Ramsey is an ex-Earth Navy pilot whose crew won't let him fly his own ship. The pilot is his ex-wife, the mechanic is a drunk, and the chief of security is from a predatory species. Instead of a star-drive to travel through the astral space between worlds, the ship's wizard does it by hand. </p> <p><i>Mission 1: Salvage Trouble</i> </p> <p>A salvage mission turns into a rescue, and no good deed goes unpunished. With two refugees onboard, the Mobius crew is hounded by bounty hunters, border patrols, and corporate enforcers. </p> <p><i>Mission 2: A Smuggler's Conscience</i> </p> <p>\"Don't open the package.\" It's the smuggler's credo for good reason. When the Mobius crew takes a peek at their illicit cargo, the entire job takes an about-face. </p> <p><i>Mission 3: Poets and Piracy</i> </p> <p>The Mobius crew gets caught in a turf war between a pirate fleet and a galactic criminal syndicate. The trick is getting everyone out alive (and maybe getting paid in the process). </p> <p><i>Mission 4: To Err is Azrin</i> </p> <p>Sometimes, you can't go home again. When a job takes the crew to their security chief's homeworld, she gets dragged into a familial power struggle. Can the rest of the crew bail her out of an old feud gone horribly wrong? </p>";
