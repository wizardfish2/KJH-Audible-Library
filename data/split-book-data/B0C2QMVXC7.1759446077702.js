However, she skipped a few steps in her education, like apprenticing to someone who actually knows what they’re doing.<br> <br> Now, Tala has to balance learning as fast as she can with paying off the veritable mountain of debt the Magic Academy dropped on her shoulders for the opportunity; not to mention staying alive.<br> <br> Even though she should only be a Mageling, the world considers her a Mage.
