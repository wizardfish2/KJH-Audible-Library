window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sheriffs on flying monsters. Marshals dueling with magic cards. Showdowns fought with creatures instead of pistols. Epic beasts destroying whole towns. And me, stuck in the middle once more....</b></p> <p>In one step, John went from a beautiful woman's embrace to the middle of a monster battle in a dusty, Old West town. His last mission could only loosely be considered a success, but he's determined to do better with this one. Or at least, not leave entire towns in flames behind him.</p> <p>In this new world, though, he finds his training doesn't count for much. Powerful and practically invulnerable handlers roam the prairie, fighting with tame monsters and magical cards, and to face them, he'll have to become a tamer himself—and maybe a bit of a monster, as well. A handler of terrible power is stealing the pets of everyone he comes across in pursuit of a goal only he knows, and it's up to John to stop him before he shatters the balance in this world...and maybe the world itself.</p> <p>John's only help comes from a vengeful sheriff and a broken marshal, neither of whom can aid in his battles. He'll have to find powerful monsters to tame, master the rules of this world's magic, and discover secrets hidden for millennia to have a chance at victory. Despite all this, he faces a foe far beyond his skills and power. He'll need every bit of skill and cunning he has—and more than a little luck—or face his final death under the green sun....</p>";
