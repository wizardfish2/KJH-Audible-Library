window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Wayne dreamed of piloting a thirty-foot-tall walking robot that was closer to a battle-tank than anything else.</b></p> <p>They were called Walkers. They were armed with laser cannons, rockets, missiles, and heavy kinetic weapons more similar to artillery pieces than guns, and everything that went with that.</p> <p>Unfortunately, he had been declined military service. His only avenue left to become a Walker Pilot was to make it happen all on his own. Under his own power. With his own hands. Literally.</p> <p>Working his fingers to the bone, saving all he could, and digging through junkyards and salvage pits, Wayne made it happen. One part at a time.</p> <p>He was now, finally, at the starting line.</p> <p>Having built a very rough Walker that he had cobbled together himself, he scavenged a few weapons that were perfect for starting out and had just enough money to afford ammunition. His long-term dream was just about to start. Perhaps he would even form his own Walker Mercenary company and hire people to work with him.</p> <p>Except just as he finally moves forward, his home world is about to take a gigantic leap backwardâ€”with Wayne at the center of it all, without ever truly realizing it.</p>";
