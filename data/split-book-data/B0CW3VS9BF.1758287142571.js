window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Greetings, friend! Rest here for a while and listenâ€”I have a quest for you.</p> <p>How would you like to study the mystical craft of artificery? You'll learn things that most people can only dream of. You'll make self-spicing cooking pots, backpacks with endless storage, and even farm plows that will do all the work for you. Who wouldn't want that?</p> <p>Even better, you'll get to live in the sunlit village of Sunhampton, a cozy little town of cobbled streets, friendly taverns, and stores that sell anything you could imagine.</p> <p>If this sounds like just the thing for you, then grab a beer and a sweet roll, and follow Lewis as he improves his magical skills.</p> <p>Lewis just passed his artificery apprenticeship, but his work isn't done. Many projects, dozens of skills, and a lifetime of magical studies lie before him and his ultimate goal: mastery of his craft.</p> <p>It'll be hard work. Perhaps even dangerous work. But with an old artificery master to teach him, and his best friends to help him, he's sure he'll get there.</p> <p>Why not get yourself over to the cozy town of Sunhampton and join him on his quest?</p>";
