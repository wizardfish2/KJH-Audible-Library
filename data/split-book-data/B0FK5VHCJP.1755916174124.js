His life was basically just day to day survival.</p> <p>That is, until he was summoned to another world in a freak accident.</p> <p>Sitting in his truck after a fender bender on the highway, Liam was questioning whether something was out to get him. At that moment, events conspired to toss him to another world. Upon arriving, he met a pair of interesting young women who had been trying to summon a creature to act as a party member and protector, as well as a school project.</p> <p>Instead they got Liam, which was more than they had bargained for, given that humans were creatures of legend and myth in their world.</p> <p>He had no sooner agreed to work with these two when the same mysterious force that transported him there promptly reversed and shot him back to Earth, leaving him with a parting message that the girls would call him back soon.</p> <p>And thus, Liam's life trying to balance his day job and being summoned to another world started. After all, what sort of mischief could his girls get up to that they'd need a \"legendary creature\" to get them out of it?</p> <p>***Summoned by Monster Girls is a portal-fantasy, LITRPG, slice-of-life, men's romance, progression fantasy about a man who is summoned to another world, but still has to maintain a day job back on Earth to keep a roof over his head. It doesn't shy away from combat, blood, and mental issues, but also includes simply sweet things like an overly-cuddly miniature lamia and wolf-girl who loves head-pats. Along with plenty of romance and other interesting monster girls.</p>";
