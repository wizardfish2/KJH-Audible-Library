Standard MMO fare - or so Cerys Collins thought.</i></b></p> <p>As a long-time gamer and guild leader, Cerys has always wondered what it would be like to live in virtual reality. When her guild members convince her to try a new VRMMO, she discovers reality is far more complex than she knew. Chosen by the gods of another world, Cerys finds herself trapped between warring factions: a tyrannical human empire and an oppressed kingdom of demons.</p> <p>When she discovers her best friend has been dragged into this new world as well, Cerys is forced to choose between saving her friend or looking at the bigger picture. If Cerys is to be anything more than a pawn in the gods' game, she'll have to leverage everything she's learned on her home world and in past games, before it's too late. With a cocky incubus king vying for more than her loyalty, her quest wonâ€™t be an easy one.</p> <p>The Deck of Souls series contains some dark themes, profanity, violence, and adult relationships. <br> <br> The Soundbooth Theater Crew for this production: </p> <ul> <li>Annie Ellicott - Narration</li> <li>Jeff Hays - Idris Bloodsong</li> <li>Justin Thomas James - Emrys, Meical, and the rest of the male cast </li> <li>Laurie Catherine Winkel - Corlyotir, Drysi, and the rest of the female cast</li> <li>Griffin Malnar - Editing, Mastering, Sound Design</li> <li>Ahmed Mahmoud - Music</li> <li>Dalton Lynne - Project Manager, Proofing</li> <li>Bonnie L.
