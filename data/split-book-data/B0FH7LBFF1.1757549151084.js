But it wouldn't be life if there weren't a few bad apples mixed in. Having clashed several times—once in a very physical fashion—with Adept Windracer, Desmond can only hope that the overly aggressive Uth'ra will stop trying to force him into the mold that she believes a male should occupy.</p> <p>Additionally, more information is coming to light about the strange group he and his instructor had fought with that had been occupying a Rift. A group that had no proper reason to be there beyond trouble, and were suspiciously short on identifying information on their persons. The rabbit-hole only grows deeper as Desmond continues to stumble upon clues, passing them along up the chain of command in hopes that someone will act before it is too late.</p> <p>Things are picking up strength as Desmond and the girls start to get a view of what is at stake. Unwilling to simply allow himself to be swept along with the tide, Arsenal continues to prepare and train themselves, gathering strength for the challenges that stand ahead of them both as an adept and his guards, and as a clan.</p> <p>*** Monster Girls In Space is a Sci-Fi, fantasy, semi-military, men’s romance, progression fantasy about a man becoming a space-wizard amongst a universe full of monster girls (it’s in the title, you should have expected that part). Expect adventure, mischief, magic, fighting, and unconventional relationships in a galaxy that is curious what sort of mischief Humanity will get up to.</p>";
