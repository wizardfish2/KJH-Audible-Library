window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>After spending some time in the realm of Oracle, Lance has started to grow accustomed to his life as a combat mage. </b>Arcwind village has fallen under his protection, his dragonblood abilities continue to evolve, and his budding relationships with the three beautiful arcanists at his side continue to blossom. </p> <p>He has become a living weapon, and even the threat of the mighty Kel’sar clan aren’t enough to shake his draconic confidence.</p> <p>But Lance has a problem.</p> <p>With his [s-rank] powers still sealed, the combat mage is unable to reach his potential and wield the full might of his draconic bloodline. However, one option still remains. On the far reaches of the savage coast lies the ruins of the Draconis Clan’s old kingdom, the citadel of rage. And within it, perhaps the key to unlocking Lance’s true potential–if he can survive the trip.</p> <p><i>This novel contains progression, harem, and LitRPG elements. It is intended for mature audiences. </i></p>";
