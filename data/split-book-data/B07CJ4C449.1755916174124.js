So they’ve packed up the car, put in all the requisite forms, gotten the approvals, and set out to start Legion up in a new city.</p> <p>The problem, though, is the local government had no idea who they were selling permits to. Approving forms for. To Felix and Legion.</p> <p>And now they’re about to find out.</p>";
