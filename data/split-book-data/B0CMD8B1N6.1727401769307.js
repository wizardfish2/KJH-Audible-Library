window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An unstoppable killing machine is unleashed to do . . . whatever she wants in this fast-paced, action-packed spin-off of the Faceless Minion series.</b></p> <p>She's unlike any <i>one</i> or any <i>thing</i> else: a Non-Standard Leashed-Intelligence Cybernetic Enforcer aka NSLICE-00P. The first of her kind, she's let loose into a universe of superheroes on behalf of her sinister masters to destroy all who oppose them.</p> <p>And everything's going according to plan—until NSLICE-00P gets hacked and sent into the past to kill her own creator before he creates her. Obeying orders as always, she wastes the poor guy. Unfortunately, there are consequences to initiating a reality-breaking time paradox. The most significant: total ejection from that reality.</p> <p>Now the cyborg finds herself in a world of skills and levels, with the distinct advantage of possessing a dungeon core. She'll have to make her way without orders, programming, or limitations. NSLICE-00P suddenly has a whole new life ahead of her. If only she can keep herself from blowing things up at the drop of a hat, she'll be just fine . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than two million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
