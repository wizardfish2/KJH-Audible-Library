window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>James thought he would be just another adventurer in the world’s most anticipated dungeon delving VRMMORPG. But when he logs in, he soon finds out that he won’t be diving the dungeon - he will be <i>creating</i> it. Pretty awesome right?</p> <p>At least that was what he thought when he boldly chose \"Random\" as his dungeon type....</p> <p>Then he summoned his first mob. A fearsome, bloodthirsty demonic.... Chicken.</p> <p>Still, Demonic Farm Animals are the least of his worries. The person who is supposed to be teaching him the ropes is a weirdly advanced AI pixie, who drinks too much and is overly fond of gambling. Oh, and some mysterious figure seems to be watching and judging his every move - so signing that NDA is feeling like less and less of a solid choice.</p> <p>Either way, James is up for the challenge. Even if it means building a dungeon around kamikaze sheep, enraged cows, unhygienic pigs, and yes...Dickens.</p> <p>At least his next randomly selected mob type can’t be worse...right?</p> <p><i>This is the revised, edited, and novelized retelling of the popular Royal Road web serial Dungeon Core Online by Glyax.</i></p>";
