This time, he will seize every opportunity, fight every monster, and plunder every treasure as he enjoys life to the fullest.</p> <p>If only it were that easy. Humans are considered one of the weakest sentient races, confined to their patch of land but that hasn't changed their nature as they fight amongst themselves forced to split their sources of power instead of unite for the greater whole. In order to see the entire vast richness of the world, Ajax must battle for his life and respect, gaining levels and forcing the other races to acknowledge his and humanities worth.</p> <p>Ajax’s Ascension to the top won’t be quick or easy.</p>";
