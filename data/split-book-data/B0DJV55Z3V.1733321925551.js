I didn't think retiring to Mexico with my Russian girlfriend would last—turns out I was right.</p> <p>What we didn't expect was that we'd be embroiled in a secret war between Heaven and Hell. Yeah, demons and angels exist, and they're about as powerful and deadly as we've been led to believe.</p> <p>To even the odds a little, the agency has decked me out with an arsenal that takes the best from above and the best from below. And humanity aren't exactly slouches, either. We have occultists–humans capable of binding supernatural creatures to their will.</p> <p>Our first job has us teaming up with a rookie occultist, and it's not long before both my Russian girlfriend and I start catching feelings. If I’m not careful, I might even find myself expanding my horizons beyond the earthly realm.</p> <p>But would that really be a bad thing?</p>";
