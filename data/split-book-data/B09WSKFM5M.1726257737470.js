window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I woke up in a battlefield triage tent, bloody, battered, and crippled.</b></p> <p>It wasn't just my arm and shoulder that was broken, but also my mind. I couldn't remember anything—my name, who or where I was, or what had happened to me.</p> <p>Could things get worse? Of course they could. The battle wasn’t over, and it appeared that our enemy wasn't content with just a victory. No. They sought to wipe us out. But why? If I lived long enough, perhaps I would find out.</p> <p>Not everything was bleak, however. I had friends at my side—ones who challenged our cowardly leaders and fought to give me a chance. We could fight together and escape. But in an ether-ravaged, post-apocalyptic world cast back into the dark ages, where feudal lords once again fight for control over land and resources, that may be easier said than done.</p> <p>Join Takemi in this wuxia-style progression fantasy as he journeys through a post-apocalyptic landscape. Ether ruined the old world, but it is building a new one, where mental constructs called mind palaces grant cultivators game-like perks and unlock almost superhuman abilities.</p>";
