window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A weak soul must not cultivate. Madness consumes the weak of mind. Eternal servitude awaits the weak of heart.</b></p> <p>Su Fang arrives in a realm of cultivation unprepared—no skills, no knowledge, and no backing. Like everyone else in this new world, he is given a blessing from the Heavenly Dao to help him success, but Su Fang's blessing isn’t power over the elements or mastery of profound arts. No, it takes a brutal lesson to teach him that he’s been ‘blessed’ with repetition.</p> <p>Every time he dies, he returns to the moment of his arrival. The young cultivator uses each reset to grind skills, refine his inner essence, and empower his very soul, using only the memories of countless failures. Each death is another lesson, each life another chance. Yet the world is ruthless, and time alone won’t be enough for Su Fang to make his mark; especially when every reset washes away not only his mistakes, but his triumphs.</p> <p><b>In a land where even the strong perish, his fate is clear: he’s an immortal destined to die. Over and over.</b></p>";
