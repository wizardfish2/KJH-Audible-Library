Britain's superhero, The Deterrent, was unveiled to the world in 1979 and disappeared two years later. The truth about his origins has never been revealed. The rumours about his children - those that survived - and their mysterious abilities have never been confirmed. Until now. </p> <p>Armed with a diary that reveals everything about The Deterrent's early years, Daniel Harbin - discovering powers of his own - finds himself dragged into the same secretive government department his famous father worked for. Can a halfhero be a better superhero than his father, or is Daniel making a terrible mistake? When the wrong people know what you're capable of, no matter how powerful you are, you're still in danger.... </p>";
