Unfortunately, life moves on, and new problems will appear, especially for their friend, the new ruler of Berber. Being orb-bonded adventurers wielding powerful magic means they have the responsibility to do what others cannot.</p> <p>Some members have left, and there will be new additions. The Delvers LLC team is solid. But while Henry creates new magi-tech and Jason perfects his deadly power, evil forces are gathering. The men from Earth had better enjoy what down time they have, because it’s not likely to last.</p> <p>Events on Ludus and out among the rest of the universe are spiraling toward something terrible. Henry Sato, Jason Booth, and Nora Hazard might find themselves being drawn toward the center of the conflict, or knowing their luck, fall right into it.</p>";
