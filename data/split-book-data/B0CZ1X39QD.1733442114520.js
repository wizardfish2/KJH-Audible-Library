window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Just when I thought life in the Eros Woods couldn't get crazier, it throws new challenges my way. First on the agenda: bringing back Londyn from the mystical realm of Interlude, where fey magic is healing her broken body. Dealings with the fey are tricky, and they've demanded a steep price for their help. One that I'm more than ready and willing to pay!</p> <p>Meanwhile, the cheerleaders and I face an urgent quest—to venture into the depths of a sentient dungeon with a thirst for blood. But this world doesn't let me rest, and once we escape the dungeon, Alana and I are told we must complete the Caduceus quest. The Healer and I must locate the other half of the powerful staff, and we soon discover the dire reason why.</p> <p>A massive army of goblins, orcs, and giants is laying siege to Moondale, and Alana’s healing skills have never been more crucial.</p> <p>However, the greatest threat isn't the horde at our gates. It's right under our roof. It’s one of our own, and she might be working with the enemy.</p>";
