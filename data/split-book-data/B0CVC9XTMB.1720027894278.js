window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Continue the ride with scholar and spell-caster Everson Croft in his second mega box set, from a confounding case of </b><b><i>Black Luck</i></b><b> to a time-traveling showdown in </b><b><i>Night Rune</i></b><b>!</b><br> <br> REMEMBER PROFESSOR CROFT?<br> <br> Still New York’s hardest-working mage (and the long-suffering owner of a talking cat), he’s a little older and wiser now. A good thing because infernal bags are detonating throughout his city, unleashing demonic beings that rip the souls of innocents from their bodies… and that’s only the beginning. Buckle up with the Prof as he’s tested as never before, in matters both hell-spawned and of the heart.<br> <br> <b>If you like occult action, spell-crackling suspense, and moments of heart, heroism, and all-out laughter, you too will love the Prof Croft series! This value set features novels 5 through 8: </b><b><i>Black Luck, Power Game, Druid Bond,</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Night Rune</i></b><b>.</b></p>";
