Except the world he's being sent to isn't the same one he came from. It's not even a similar period in time, but from something long past in history. </p> <p>The dark ages. </p> <p>And part of the deal to live again, is to make pacts with others. Pacts that would bind others in secrecy. That they could never speak of what they'd done. </p> <p>Deals for anything, and everything. From things as simple as a meal to their very lives. How much would you give of yourself to live on in the world is an easy question. </p> <p>The better question is, how much would you take from others? </p> <p>If Alex wants to keep living, to keep his soul from being sent to the darkest corner of hell, he'll have to ask himself that question.
