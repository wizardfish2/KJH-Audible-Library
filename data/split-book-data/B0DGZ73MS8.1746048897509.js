window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Everyone needs a place to call their own – Even monster girls!</b></p> <p>My family has run Sugarville’s one and only B&amp;B for years. Sure, it's a little rundown and the gardens are overgrown, but it’s still got what I like to call rustic charm. If things go my way, it’ll become a cozy shelter for Hellhounds, Alicorns, Kobolds, and more!</p> <p>Yup – I’ve just become the manager of a government-run home for monster girls. Not only will I need to patch the roof, fix the barn, and master my burgeoning magic, but I’ll also need to help our guests adapt to living on Earth!</p> <p>However, unscrupulous forces are prowling about, trying to exploit monster girls for their arcane power. I have to keep the women under my care safe.</p> <p><b>Welcome to the Elseworlders B&amp;B – we hope you enjoy your stay!</b></p>";
