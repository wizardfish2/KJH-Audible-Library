Everyone there knew full well what a Healer from the Order was capable of . . . And they also know that a Healer doesn't have to kowtow to anybody.</p> <p>But now, I'm no longer in that world. And in this world, I am not only a great Healer, I am also a great count, one that can do far more than heal, as my enemies know full well. But little do they know that I've only just begun!</p> <p>I'm on my way to restoring the Bulatov Family's fiefdom, and I have everything I need now, including forces from another world. Yes, why wouldn't Offworlders want to serve me? After all, the benefits I provide are excellent, especially the health care.</p> <p>Of course, in return they must work hard . . . What can I say? Either work, or keep out of my way!</p>";
