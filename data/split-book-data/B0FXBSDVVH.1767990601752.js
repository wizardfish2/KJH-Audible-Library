Then he got recruited for the X-treme Dungeon Crawl special event, and suddenly he's got bigger problems than some possessive monster girls.</p> <p>Enter The Flame Drakes: a temporary dream team that's actually a nightmare waiting to blow up in Garth's face. Meanwhile, Goddess Liara keeps sending increasingly suggestive quest notifications to Garth's HUD, Dr. Dickson is running illegal betting schemes for each of Garth's matches, and somehow Garth himself ends up judging cosplay competitions while dodging t-shirt cannons and marriage proposals left and right. All this while his beloved Phoenixes prepare for playoffs.</p> <p>Between divine interventions, a yandere kitsune, and teammates who can't decide whether to backstab each other or work together, Garth discovers that the real X-treme challenge isn't the dungeons... It's staying sane until the games actually start.</p>";
