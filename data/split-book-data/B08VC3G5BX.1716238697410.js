There’s a prophecy to ignore.</b></p> <p>Jim was thrust back in time, returned to his body at the moment he started cultivating. Anyone else might have given up, but Jim doesn’t have that option. He’s already made the mistakes that doomed him in his first life, and he knows what to do to make it right. Jim wants to right the wrongs of the past...or future? All while a pair of angry gods torture him through lack of sleep.</p> <p>He must find a way to reach the top of the cultivation world without drawing the attention of those who would take his knowledge of the future for themselves. Jim has seen how the world ended, and he is determined to fight his way through the world’s hidden foes and defeat his destiny.</p> <p>Weakened to merely a shadow of his former strength, he quickly learns that fighting alone may not be his best option, even though fate seems to like it that way.</p> <p>Luckily for the world, Jim thinks fate is stupid. He doesn’t care what it wants.</p>";
