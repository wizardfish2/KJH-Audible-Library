They live among the human realms, waiting for their moment to strike.</p> <p>Prince Gray, heir to the throne, has discovered these shapeshifters. Stopping this hidden force will require alliances with creatures beyond the edge of civilization: a secluded tribe of beastkin women.</p> <p>The all-female tribe exists on the edge between human and animal.
