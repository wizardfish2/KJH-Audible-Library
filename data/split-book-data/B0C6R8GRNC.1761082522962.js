He tried his hand at Smithing, Sword Fighting, and even at being an Artisan, but he never got many results for his efforts.</p> <p>One look at his Aetheric Record was generally enough to humble him as he had no skill beyond the basic level. He had no skill trees, no saving experience, and no class features.</p> <p>One day, however, when he’s messing around in his father’s forge, etching small symbols into a blade as a gift for his best friends Yana, the glyphs start glowing and awaken something in him.</p> <p><i>New Class Acquired! Artificer: Level One</i></p> <p>Artificer? What in the void was that? He had never heard of such a thing, and no one around him seems to have a clue either. Still, Renan is determined to find out how it all works so he can help the community with his new powers.</p> <p>When strange shadows attack his village, and he barely manages to chase them away with one of his new creations, he decides to join a group of Adventurers to investigate the threat and make sure everyone will be safe. In the process, he learns that his mysterious Class may be more than meets the eye.</p> <p>Renan thought that getting a Class would be an end in itself, but it turns out it’s only just the beginning—the beginning of the Artificer’s Chronicles!</p>";
