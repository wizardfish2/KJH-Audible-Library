It feels like I've done so much already, but truth is, I'm just getting started. A whole universe lies before me, chock full of Lilith's followers and demons, and it's my job to not only find my way to her personal realm, but do so without losing my sanity, morality, or any of my companions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Wish me luck.
