He's got everything he's ever dreamed of having: freedom to tell the stories he wants to tell, legions of enthusiastic fans who wait eagerly to see what he'll write next, and a really nice car.</p> <p>But despite all that, Bruce finds himself dissatisfied, battling an ennui he can't quite put his finger on. So he decides to do what anyone would do in his situation: burn it all down by unexpectedly killing off Carpathian Einzgear, Riftbreaker's cherished hero. A solid plan with absolutely no downside whatsoever.</p> <p><i>Until</i> . . .</p> <p>Bruce wakes up to find himself suddenly transported inside the world of the novels he's written. <i>And</i> . . . seen by everyone he encounters as Carpathian Einzgear himself. Which is problematic for a variety of reasons, not least of which being that, when Carpathian died, he left behind a sea of destruction, broken promises, and shattered lives that Bruce is now responsible for repairingâ€”only, without access to all the powers and skills Carpathian built up through the course of ten books. Bruce is going to have to start over at the beginning.</p> <p>Meet Your Maker is a comedic, epic fantasy series that asks the questions: What is fiction? What is reality? And does it make a difference, when everyone and everything is trying to kill you?</p> <p>Bruce created this world. Now he has to survive it.</p>";
