window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Delve into the penultimate chapter of the gripping Infinite Realm saga!</i></b></p> <p>Years have passed since the devastating war tore through the heart of the Settled Territories, reshaping the balance of power in ways previously unimaginable. Yet, tranquility remains elusive as the looming threat of the Domes, ancient prisons harboring horrors rivaling that of Hastur, edges closer to unleashing chaos upon the world. Faced with the imminent danger posed by the Domes' impending breach, the disparate factions of the Infinite Realm must unite to confront this peril before it wreaks havoc upon their unprepared world.</p> <p>Amidst the tumult, a shadowy force stirs once more. The Unchained, driven by their enigmatic objectives, maneuver in the darkness, while a primordial terror, a creature of unfathomable might and cunning, lurks behind their machinations. Emerging from the shadows is Ra'azel, the Runesmith, orchestrating his own intricate schemes, poised to tip the scales of power in his favor.</p>";
