His buddy has been hiding a starship from him.</b></p> <p>Mitch's mediocre life has just taken a turn for the worse, so his buddy tries to cheer him up by showing him a secret starship. Unfortunately, everything goes south when hostile aliens arrive. In an effort to save his buddy and the starship from the aliens, Mitch does the obvious thing: he accidentally warps hundreds of light-years away.</p> <p>Marooned in a distant star cluster, Mitch is forced to deal with a snarky teenage AI, a rogue auto-pilot, and a beautiful alien soldier who's ready to steal his ship at any momentâ€”so she can fight an oppressive military faction, of course.</p> <p>Will Mitch simply use the starship to return home? Or will his attractive, though slightly frustrating, new co-pilot convince him to help the struggling Resistance movement?</p> <p><i>If you enjoy humorous \"Found Spaceship\" adventures, then you'll love </i>My Buddy Gave Me a Starship.</p>";
