But the growing community isn't without dangers....</b></p> <p>Between raiding Red Caps and dives into the local dungeon, danger seems to lurk around every corner. Adventure. It makes Hall wonder if he should remain as Lord of Skara Brae.

Why is Hall encountering signs of Bastion The Sage everywhere? What role does the Sage play in the events around Hall? </p> <p><b>Find out in the fifth installment of the Sky Realms Online LitRPG saga!</b></p>";
