window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Felix would like nothing more than to take a vacation. A long one. One where he didn’t have to wake up every morning and worry over casualty lists for the day.</p> <p>Ever since he and the Legion had been forced to flee their headquarters four years previous, nothing had gone quite right. In fact, Felix and the Legion have been locked in a shadow war with enemies unknown. Ones with magic that could carve through their technology easily.</p> <p>As the rest of the world fell apart, tearing itself to pieces at every turn with the return of the old gods, the Legion has held the chaos back. The price in blood has been climbing slowly, lately.</p> <p>Felix suspects there’s a change on the horizon. One that he hasn’t prepared or developed a plan for. Or so his paranoia has been telling him. That there’s a change coming now that’ll shake up the world. One that will turn it inside out, Legion and Felix along with it.</p> <p>Felix has decided it’s time to push ahead and act. To finish things and protect his people at the same time. To take his Legion and make it safe.</p> <p>Because that’s all that matters in the end to him. His Legion. And it always came first.</p> <p><i>Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show.
