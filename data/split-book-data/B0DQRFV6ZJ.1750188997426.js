window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John, a vampire living for near six thousand years, has gone by many names in his life. Warrior, king, god. Such great age can also be a curse, as his mind has not kept up with the regeneration of his body, and he struggles to even remember his own name.<br> <br> That is until powerful beings called the <i>ascended</i> come to Earth and remove a shield blocking our solar system from the Tree of Life. John is healed, and his mind restored, and he is ready to learn this new way of gaining power, this self-cultivation, and defend his world. But he's no longer the apex predator. A high ascended wants his head, and armies of demons, dark ones, and g'athu stand in his path.<br> <br> John has accumulated many skills throughout his life, and with the NCS giving him knowledge and guidance on the ways and techniques of self-cultivation; he is determined to fight. Joined by the strange and beautiful Amber, a woman as extraordinary as any vampire, John endeavors to grow in might.<br> <br> It's a race for survival, and if humans manage to endure the current invasion, their only prize will be a far deadlier one. Vampires are unknown, could John and his kin be the reason Earth was kept from the Tree of Life?</p>";
