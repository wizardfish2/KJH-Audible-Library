window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The complete series in a single offering! Survive the apocalypse, conquer in the arena, and become the ultimate gladiator.</b></p> <p>My life took a turn I never expected on the day the world ended. Suddenly forced to fight in a bloody arena by a faceless System, I find the only way to survive is to win. I’m told that ten victories in the arena will give me my freedom, but if I’m going to get there, I’ll need a crack team of hardened allies to fight with me.</p> <p>What I got instead was a bratty college girl with a jealousy streak, a momma’s boy roommate who now inhabits the body of a piglet, and a devastatingly gorgeous teacher whose sword is as sharp as her tongue. If we could learn to work together, we might just win this thing—and even take the time to rescue an innocent blonde from my past.</p> <p>But the sands of the arena are treacherous and unforgiving. And even though my legendary warlord subclass comes with mysterious benefits in the bedroom and the arena, our new overlords would love nothing more than to see us ground into dust.</p> <p>I’m told the System rewards bravery. Guess it’s time to find out.</p>";
