window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Dawn Alliance holds Novograd in a steel fist, protected by a battle fleet and an armored space station. The factories of Novograd are the key to the war. Whoever controls the planet controls the Green Zone - and that means the station must be destroyed. </p> <p>The station will be a tough nut to crack, but Tom Thrush has a plan. The key to cracking a nut is to bring a big enough hammer. Thereâ€™s a crippled Dawn Alliance battleship limping home from the Battle of New Panama. His plan is simple: Board the battleship, take control, and use it as a Trojan horse in a desperate assault on the station. </p> <p>All he has to do is find the battleship in the trackless wastes of hyperspace, fight his way onboard, take over, and set course for Novograd. </p> <p>With a little luck, a lot of courage, and an iron will, the station will fall - and the real battle will begin.</p>";
