He's doing his best to let go of his anger.</p> <p>While his team is caught up in duty, Jason has no shortage of people looking to interfere with his rest. Enemies—old and new—are circling, and even would-be allies are trouble.

As the pressure on him mounts, allies and enemies alike will find that out the hard way.</p>";
