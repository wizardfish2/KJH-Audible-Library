window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Omnians, Earthers, and alliance members are fighting the Colony, the horde of sentient insectoids that threaten alliance space.</p> <p>The Colony has had centuries to expand through the network of domes built by the Messinants, an ancient race. The domes’ Q-gates allow the insectoids to invade planets through their inventive use of rings, which extends the power of the domes.</p> <p>It’s Omnian superior technology that gives a temporary advantage to the peaceful alliance members who lead the fight to retake their planets.</p> <p>Omnian warships and fighters, Tridents and travelers, possess beam weapons to destroy the Colony’s shuttles and transports. However, the Colony escalates, turning its transports into deadly explosive traps.</p> <p>In the past, the few alliance races that fought back could barely hold the line against the Colony’s seemingly never-ending incursions. Now, Jess Cinders leads a group of dedicated veterans armed with explosive dart weapons borrowed from the Loopah race.</p> <p>Again, it’s the Omnian advanced tech that changes the dynamics in favor of the veterans. Engineers upgrade an invention first used decades ago. It’s a shadow, a multilegged avatar, with a mounted laser.</p> <p>Unfortunately, for those races fighting to halt the Colony’s expansion, the insectoids aren’t willing to retreat. They fight back with even deadlier tactics that take the lives of the unwary.</p>";
