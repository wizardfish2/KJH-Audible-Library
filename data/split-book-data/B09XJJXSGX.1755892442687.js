This 100-Floor Tower is greater in scope than anything he’d ever created before, and according to the Event, he only has six months in which to complete it. Even more than that, the Dungeon Core needs to somehow train the massive influx of Heroes in a new way so that they are prepared for the Tower of Trials.</p> <p>But how can Clay juggle his normal dungeon training and designing an entirely new Tower at the same time? Sometimes the only choice is to embrace the challenge, take some risks, and go all-in.</p> <p><b>Note: </b>This final book in the Serious Probabilities series contains Dungeon Core, LitRPG, and GameLit elements including dungeon construction and defense, monster summoning, character progression, and a game-like interface. In addition, many of the probabilities the world is based upon are similar to Gacha-type mechanics. Contains no profanity, harems, or explicit sexual content.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
