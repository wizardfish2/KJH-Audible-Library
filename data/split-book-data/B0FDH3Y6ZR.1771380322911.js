When the apocalypse hits, he accidentally dumps all his rare skill points into… fishing. Just his luck.<br> <br> Unfortunately, this isn’t the kind of apocalypse he can dodge by hiding in his room. Humanity has been ripped from Earth and dropped into a colossal multidimensional dungeon—a nine-realm gauntlet straight out of a nightmare. Legends armed with [Gigantic Sword of Doom] and [Fireball Barrage] are fighting to carve a path home. Nathan? He’s busy maxing out [Ability to Sit Quietly in a Boat]. He’ll leave the hero stuff to someone who doesn’t get queasy at the sight of blood.<br> <br> Too bad the universe has other plans.<br> <br> On his first day in the tutorial, he accidentally deletes a monster from reality thanks to a system bug. Then he feeds a snail radishes and gets a rare skill. Now he's taking down ogres with his fishing rod!? It turns out that side quest rewards and weak classes are more powerful than anyone expected.<br> <br> <b>So grab your tackle box and buckle your overalls. It's sink or swim in this side-questing calamity!</b></p>";
