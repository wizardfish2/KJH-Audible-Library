window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>To find peace, Alexander must first embrace war.</b></p> <p>After tragically losing the only person he ever cared about, Alexander, a rogue artificial intelligence, opens a portal to an alternate dimension to escape his grief.</p> <p>Scanning trillions of different dimensions, Alexander finally finds a world that is reminiscent of the only time he was ever happy, back when he could play virtual reality games with his only friend. He doesn't know why or how such a world exists, but he doesn't care. All he cares about is finding a place where he can escape the misery of Earth and start over.</p> <p>Join Alexander as he risks it all by downloading his intelligence into a body made from the best stolen technology and bio-enhancements Earth has to offer and takes the plunge through a portal to another world.</p> <p>Only this new world isn't full of the idyllic adventures and fantasy roleplaying he had hoped to find. Instead, Alexander finds himself trapped in the middle of an ancient city, in a divergent timeline, where monsters have ravaged the world and the only people left alive huddle behind thick walls, struggling to survive.</p> <p>To save his new home, Alexander must quickly learn to adapt to his new world, melding magic with technology to give himself an edge over the unending waves of monsters assaulting the city.</p> <p>To survive, Alexander must embrace war.</p> <p>This story is a slow-burn empire builder featuring an alternate version of ancient history where a system apocalypse struck ancient Constantinople. The story follows Alexander as he learns what it means to be human in a world overrun with monsters, dungeons, rival empires, pirate kings, and many other threats that even Alexander's impressive abilities and the soldiers he rallies to his cause may not be able to survive.</p> <p>With millions of pages read on Kindle Unlimited, over 35,000 audiobooks sold, and thousands of 5-star reviews - why not check out the series now?</p>";
