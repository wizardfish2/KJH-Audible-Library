window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He's arrogant. A certified pain in the butt. Maybe just crazy enough to survive.</b></p> <p>Jack Atlas, self-proclaimed 'World's Best Assassin', had a simple plan: retire in style and marry the girl of his dreams. Then he gets placed in The Tower—a divine deathtrap where gods pit their creations against each other for the ultimate prize: eternal paradise for you and your friends. The catch? If you lose, well, let's just say your chances of finding a decent bar in oblivion are slim.</p> <p>Jack, who’s never met a hornet’s nest he didn’t want to kick, soon finds himself on the wrong side of The Black Centipede, a notorious assassin cult with a charming recruitment policy: join or they’ll murder everyone he loves.</p> <p>Instead of sipping Mai Tai’s on some beach he can’t pronounce; it’s slurping down health potions because he got stabbed by a goblin with a particular fondness for stabbing him in the rear. Heroic quests? Conquer The Tower, appease his assassin overlords, reunite with his dream girl? Nope. Jack instead gets sent to 'dungeon timeout' for bad behavior. That's fine by him.</p> <p>If anyone’s crazy enough to not just survive, but <i>win </i>against The Tower, it’s Jack.</p>";
