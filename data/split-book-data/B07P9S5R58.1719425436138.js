A universe where people really can increase in skill and power, becoming so much more than they once were. </p> <p>All it takes is the locked potential of every foe you slay, their stories becoming your own. </p> <p>Yet there is horror as well as wonder in this magical realm, and when Val locks gazes with a beautiful girl moments away from death, he comes face-to-face with a lost tribe of people long thought extinct. Just a handful of survivors, and thousands more trapped in deepest slumber, only hours away from death. </p> <p>Even as Val embraces the most perilous and noble task of his life, an entire dreadnought filled with enemy soldiers readies itself for the next step in their campaign of conquest, and Earth is the prize they will claim. </p> <p>To bad they didn't see Val coming. No one ever does.</p>";
