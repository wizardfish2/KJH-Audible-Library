Don't miss this one, O, Knights of Knightley!</b></p> <p><b>***</b></p> <p>He's doing his best to save the monsters. And they're doing their worst.</p> <p>Nathaniel wakes up in a fancy bed with luxurious red sheets, being doted upon by two... interesting women. Not a bad start to his day, right? Except that this isn't where he went to bed last night, and these chicks? A ghost and a vampire, both pretty spooky—and quirky—to say the least.</p> <p>He comes to learn that he is the last known scion of the Van Helsing bloodline. However, his new job isn't to hunt monsters, but to save them. As he adjusts to this quest, Nathan struggles to come to grips with his surroundings and the revelation that the universe is a lot bigger and crazier than he imagined.</p> <p>Also, this bratty catgirl won't let him get any work done.</p>";
