They’ve faded into whispers and old tales.</p> <p>Mollie Reynolds wasn't just the leader of a band of resistors; she was a young Adept under the guidance of a Zin Master, her mind becoming attuned to the subtle vibrations of Algorithmic Prophecy—a metaphysical craft that wove fate with the threads of potential futures. But she hasn’t seen her father, the legendary Captain Jason Reynolds, or her sister, Boomer, in over a decade. Ricket, Dira, Gunny Orion… Those valiant figures from the Craing War have all vanished.

They’ve ghosted humanity, taking their cutting-edge warships with them.</p> <p>Mollie stands at a precipice, facing three Herculean challenges.

Third: In the midst of chaos, locate her missing father.</p> <p>Enter Captain Matt Briggs. Does he come with baggage? Sure. More than a little attitude? Maybe.

Fend off the swiftly approaching Velon threat? It’s a coin toss.</p> <p><i>This new saga voyages through the realms of Space Opera, Space Fleet, Alien Invasion, Metaphysical Visionary, and Military Science Fiction.</i></p>";
