window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Wizard scouts are the elite, deep-recon forces of the Intergalactic Empire. The Intergalactic Wizard Scout Academy has been producing wizard scouts for over 800 years, but is the Academy's long history coming to an end? </p> <p>Richard is only in his junior year at the Academy, but it may well be his last. The war with the bat-like Crosioians is straining the resources of the Intergalactic Empire to the breaking point. Every soldier is needed on the front lines to stave off the Empire's destruction. Not to mention politicians are eyeing the Academy as a financial drain that can no longer be justified. To top things off, teams of spell-wielding magic users have been spotted reconnoitering near the Academy. What does it all mean? </p> <p>Between the Crosioians, politicians, and magic users, Richard and his friends are being assaulted from every side. The fate of the Academy, and indeed the entire Empire, may well lie in their hands. Outnumbered and outgunned, what can mere cadets do? But they're wizard scout cadets, and it'll be a cold day on Sirius when they'll let anyone threaten their Academy without a fight. </p> <p>Join Richard and his friends as they stare near-certain defeat in the face. Will their wizard scout training be enough? Not even the best calculations of the battle computer, Nickelo, can tell for sure. But one thing's for certain, the Crosioians picked the wrong cadets to mess with. </p>";
