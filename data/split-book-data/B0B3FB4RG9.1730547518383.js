window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Just because he's small doesn't mean Paradox can't level up big-time. The Great Core demands it!</b></p> <p>Name: Paradox</p> <p>Species: Snake</p> <p>Description: A tiny snake with great potential.</p> <p>That was who I was. That was what I was, a tiny snake with great potential. The sole creation of the Great Core. It was just us—the great core and I—tucked away in our little corner of the world dungeon. Together, we hid from the bad things and the Coreless of the world outside, safe from the horrors that would consume us. Until one day, the Coreless found us. Until they tried to steal away my creator. Until with no other option, I swallowed the Great Core that had made me. Only after that, did I become what I was always meant to be.</p> <p>At last, I became the Great Core's Paradox in more than name.</p> <p>Thus begins the story of a little snake zealot and his journey to greatness in Book One of a crunchy time-loop LitRPG series perfect for fans of Kenneth Arant, RinoZ, and Jonathan Smidt.
