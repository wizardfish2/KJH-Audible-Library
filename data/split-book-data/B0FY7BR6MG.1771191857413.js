Ascend beyond the realm of gods.</b></p> <p>For thousands of years, the cycle of fate repeats itself: the Death God is reborn, only to be slain by a [Hero] chosen by the Goddess of Life. Having reached the peak of power just like his predecessors who died before him, Nox the Death God realizes something they never did—that resisting his fate is pointless, so he accepts his death.</p> <p>But that was all a part of his plan to break the cycle of destiny once and for all.</p> <p>By altering the reincarnation process to retain his memories before his death, he wakes up in the body of Eli, a recently murdered orphan in the small city of Velmond. With a large portion of both his death magic abilities and his vast pool of mana from his previous life, he completes the first part of his plan and gives himself a real chance of escaping his inevitable demise in this life.</p> <p>The next step to achieving his goal is by becoming a [Healer] and enrolling in the Holy Academy of the Church of Life…the very same organization that killed him in his past life. So he will have to hide his true identity, all the while also dealing with bandits, monsters, and the mysterious Avatars of Death that came about during the 10 years after his passing.</p> <p>And the final step of his plan? Transcend the power of even gods by becoming stronger than ever before.</p>";
