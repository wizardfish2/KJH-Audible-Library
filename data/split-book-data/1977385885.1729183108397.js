As it turns out, the idea of using a flying dungeon as a war machine is very tempting indeed.</p> <p>Dale has been facing his trials better than anyone could have hoped for, but when the war takes a turn for the worse, his role is forcibly relinquished. Since his only chance at survival is painful and rapid advancement, Dale must learn if his strength of will can develop into strength of flesh.</p> <p>The distance between the Heavens and the Earth might not be so far after all.</p>";
