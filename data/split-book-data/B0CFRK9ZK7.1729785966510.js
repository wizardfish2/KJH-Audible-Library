window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A young woman must navigate the dangers of a strange new world filled with magic and mystery in this imaginative and highly detailed LitRPG adventure.</b></p> <p>When Alice Verianna went to sleep, she was just another teen from the Denver suburbs. She definitely didn't expect to be transported to a magical alternate dimension, inhabited by monsters and presided over by a mysterious System. Here, people resemble RPG characters and everyone has access to their own status screens.</p> <p>Grappling with the mechanics of the elusive System isn't the only challenge Alice faces. It seems an underground organization known as the Society of Starry Eyes has taken a particular interest in other dimensions. If they find out about Alice, they will stop at nothing to hunt her down and forcibly extract from her the secrets of her world.</p> <p>Now, in addition to pursuing her own scientific endeavors, as well as learning to harness the magic that surrounds her, Alice must determine the Society's ultimate intention—and how she ended up here in first place. Before it's too late . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with almost two million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
