He's going to take the initiative and that includes freeing the enslaved dragons and establishing Scale Nation, a place for all dragons.</p> <p>Of course, that's just a stepping stone to restoring the proper rulership of dragons.</p> <p>Book four in this series continues the same world-building and relationships but provides significant steps forward for Nico and Cami as well as a deeper understanding of the connection between the past and the present, the gods and the dragons.</p>";
