Time Traveler. </p> <p>Prisoner. </p> <p>There is nothing Denny wants more than to repair the damage former rewinder Lidia has done to history. </p> <p>Her manipulations have thrown the time line he knows into chaos, and now he's locked away in an unfamiliar world, without the device that would allow him to fix what has been destroyed. Will Denny be able to bring back the life he knew and the people he loves, or will he be trapped in this violent time line forever? </p> <p>Only time will tell. </p>";
