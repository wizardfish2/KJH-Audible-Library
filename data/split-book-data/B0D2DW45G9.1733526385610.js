Unfortunately, he wasn’t returned home after the typical probing associated with such things to tell an unbelievable story to his friends. Instead, he was summarily killed, and his consciousness was inserted into a Station Core, a giant metal egg-shaped object that could use technology to create traps, Combat Units, and other defenses to protect not just himself, but those he cared about. <br> <br> Through many difficult scenarios and by adapting to his new form, Milton was eventually able to escape the planet he crash-landed upon with the help of some new friends. Now, traveling back to Collective space using the ships he had built with the help of his versatile drones, the Station Core’s goal is to fulfill a promise to his personal AI guide, ALANNA, to free the races that had built his Core from the grips of the Heliothropes, a war-like race that had been threatening to overtake them when he was abducted so long ago.<br> <br> What they find waiting for them when they arrive is not what any of them were expecting.</p> <p><i>Dimensional Dungeon Cores is a continuation of the Station Cores, Dungeon Crafting, Dungeon World, and Dungeon Fairy series, though it can be enjoyed without having listened to any of the previous books. This story contains LitRPG and GameLit mechanics, Dungeon Core elements including dungeon construction and defense, and optional stat tables in the form of footnotes. Contains scarce foul language, no harems, and no sexual content.</i></p>";
