Stuck in his own apartment for most of the time, he ventured into and conquered two dangerous Dungeons. Naturally, it wouldn't have been possible without the incredibly helpful draconic Berserker lady assisting him all the way.</p> <p>Yet, two will not mark the end, not even close. Lucas and Aisha will need to continue their dangerous expeditions if they want to stay alive and grow stronger. There is no time for rest when the world is in danger. Though, besides their newly recruited companion, they might finally have a chance to work alongside the other Defenders.</p> <p>But, are they sure that's a good thing?</p>";
