These beings have decades, centuries or even millennia of experience living within The System and wield powers far beyond the mutated Beasts and mana-spawned Monsters Drew and his friends have faced in the past.</p> <p>While the newly established settlement of Sanctuary flourishes, much of humanity is hanging on by a thread. The small communities that have managed to eke out an existence know nothing of the horrors that await them at the hands of the more gruesome Incursion races. Even hastily fortified cities stand little chance against their onslaught.</p> <p>To survive in the face of this new threat, and save what is left of humanity, Drew and his family are forced to level up in The Baleful Lady’s own treacherous training dungeon. An experience that might be even more dangerous than the Incursions themselves.</p> <p>Forced past his limits, Drew must learn to use his System-granted necromantic powers in frightening new ways… or accept that humanity’s extinction is inevitable.</p>";
