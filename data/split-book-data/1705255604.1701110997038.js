window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"This series is worth your time.\" (Jim Butcher, number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of The Dresden Files)</b></p> <p>What do shadows darting across the walls, cryptic writing, black fog, and a little girl who can see ghosts have in common? Paranormal investigator and soul without a body Vincent Graves has 44 hours to find out.</p> <p>To make matters worse, his years of body-hopping and monster-hunting are catching up with him. He's losing his mind. An old contact has shut him out. To top it all off, something's skulking through an asylum, killing patients.</p> <p>Three guesses who might be next, and the first two don't count. The writing on the wall is not so clear. But one thing is: If he doesn't figure this out he's a dead man - well, deader - and a strange young girl might follow. Vincent's got his back against a wall, and that wall's crumbling.</p> <p>Some days it's not worth it to wake up in someone else's body.</p>";
