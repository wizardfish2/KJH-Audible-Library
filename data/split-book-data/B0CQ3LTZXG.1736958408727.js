But unfortunately, the Geckho fell to an enemy onslaught, leaving planet Earth to fend for itself. And now, Earth humanity has precious little time to prove to their galactic neighbors that they are not to be trifled with.</p> <p>Thankfully though, they have not only the mighty Army of Earth and a capable space fleet, but also something unique of which no other race can boast—Gnat and his ancient cruiser, which can travel instantly to any point in the Universe, breaking all conventional strictures and laws of war.</p>";
