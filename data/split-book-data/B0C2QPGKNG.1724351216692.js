Whispers that monsters from myth have reappeared to terrorize the land spread like wildfire, and the legend of an ancient sleeping dragon begins to stir.</p> <p>It’s up to EDGE Force—a clandestine organization that leverages the best and brightest humanity has to offer—to defend against threats that can’t be fought by traditional means.</p> <p>Six months have passed since the events of Mori Island that changed JD Rideout’s perception of the nature of reality. For the first time in a long time, life is good.
