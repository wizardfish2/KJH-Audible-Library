window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Assemble, train, compete, dominate. </b></p> <p><b>Books One to Three</b></p> <p>Frank lived for his three sons, busting his back to see they thrived in comfort. His good-for-nothing wife, she made him the happiest man in the world when she finally agreed to his divorce terms. His glorious day turned to ruin when an explosion hurled him through an unformed portal connection.</p> <p>Lost to eternity and stuck in the void, a happenstance encounter allows him to relocate to the fantasy world of Dorbin. There's a drawback to Dorbin. It's a violent planet filled with ruthless cutthroats, hideous mythical creatures, and all the activities a heathen could ever wish for. Even the national militaries turn a blind eye to the atrocities, only enforcing the laws when they see fit.</p> <p>The designer of Dorbin calls themselves the Creator. The Creator established a system of kiosks for trading, point tracking, and quest rewards. The being is all-powerful and incredibly uncaring, and yet, they gave him a second chance. He arrives marred from the explosion, unable to speak the local language, and about infinitely cleaner than anyone else on the planet.</p> <p>The challenges for Frank will be steep, the learning curve arduous, and the chances of going home slim to none. It doesn't take long for Frank to realize there's no place in Dorbin for the weak or the meek. If he wants to survive, he will have to earn it, and the ends sure as hell justify the means; especially when he selects to become an arena managerâ€”a dominus of the pits.</p> <p>Warning: This book is set in a brutal fantasy world that predates modern society's values. It contains violence, gore, slavery, and other grimdark traits, along with fantastical beings and LitRPG elements. <i>Think Game of Thrones </i>with bloody gladiator fighting, mercenary teambuilding, and set from one man's perspective. If you don't have the stomach for such content, have a nice day. If you want action, violence, and to be entertained, welcome to Team Zeppelin.</p>";
