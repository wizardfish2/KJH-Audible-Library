And to do that, we’ll need the shifters as well as the vampires.</p> <p>Except, shifters and vampires would rather kill each other than work together. And after a surprise run-in with a strangely powerful goblin, my world is slapped sideways.</p> <p>If I can’t learn the strange new power I totally-didn’t-steal-because-it-wasn’t-my-fault, and can’t get arch nemeses to work together for the common good, the Guild will finally have their prize. Me.</p> <p>This epic adventure will leave you breathless!</p> <p>Performed by Jeri Marshall, Renee Dorian, Alyssa Keegan, Robb Moreira, Gabriel Michael, Ian Putnam, Rayner Gabriel, Julie Hoverson, Nanette Savard, Terence Aselford, Michael John Casey, Rob McFadyen, Lise Bruneau, Scott McCormick, Carolyn Kashner, Michael Glenn, Earl Fisher, Christopher Graybill, Sheree Wichard, James J.
