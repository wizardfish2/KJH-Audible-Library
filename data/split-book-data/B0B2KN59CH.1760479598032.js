Well . . . it's not so bad when you are an introverted battle junkie like me.</p> <p>Honestly, I was almost starting to appreciate being left behind while everyone else was given the chance to prepare for the mess Earth had gotten itself into. On a side note, it turns out I'm pretty good at hunting monsters. Though dragons and such are a bit out of my league. Just a bit.</p> <p>I survived dozen-something kobolds that wanted me dead, and now it's time to pay back their leader. Unfortunately for the poor doggies, I have made some allies. Allies they're gonna hate.</p> <p>There's just one tiny detail that bothers me. My talking cat companion is hiding something. Something big. Something that has the potential to make deadly monsters the least of my worries . . .</p>";
