window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dragons in space? A preposterous legend. But when star pilot Jael defies an abusive ship's master and rigs \"the mountain route\" through the hyperdimensional Flux, the dragons indeed appear—and challenge her to duel. If she escapes, will she ever dare this route again? Fate has its ways, and when next the currents of space bring her near, she finds Highwing the dragon under sentence of death for the kindness he showed her. Only Jael can intervene—and so she must, for the sake of the one who risked his life to save hers.</p><p>A genre-bending novel of the Star Rigger Universe, from the Nebula-nominated author of <i>Eternity’s End</i> and <i>The Chaos Chronicles.</i></p>";
