Her books are a swashbuckling joyride through History' <b>C. K. MCDONNELL</b><br> <br> --<br> <br> They say that History is just one damned thing after another. Welcome to St Mary's Institute of Historical Research - where damned things happen every day.<br> <br> When Dr Madeleine 'Max' Maxwell is recruited by St Mary's, she finds their methods to be somewhat unorthodox. They don't just study the past - they actually visit it, carefully observing historical events as they unfold in real time. <br> <br> And not dying. This last part is important. <br> <br> The whole of History now lies before Max and her new colleagues, but, as she will discover, time travel is never straightforward. Because History doesn't like to be messed with, and danger lurks in every century...<br> <br> <b>Fast-paced, witty and delightfully unconventional, </b><b><i>Just One Damned Thing After Another</i></b><b> is the first in Jodi Taylor's beloved and bestselling Chronicles of St Mary's series. For fans of Terry Pratchett, </b><b><i>Doctor Who</i></b><b>, Genevieve Cogman and </b><b><i>Ghosts</i></b><b>. </b><br> <br> </p>";
