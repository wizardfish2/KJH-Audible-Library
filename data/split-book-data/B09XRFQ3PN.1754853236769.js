Now I'm a skin-and-bones weakling wearing nothing but my hospital gown. Oh yeah, the world is also full of monsters, and I'm the only human left.</p> <p>It turns out a godlike System evacuated humanity but decided to leave the vegetable in the bed. From the moment my parents named me Lex Lurker, I was destined to be ignored. Everyone else has received a chance to prepare for what's to come in the Tutorial. I've only gotten a snarky talking cat for a companion.</p> <p>I could crawl into a corner and wait to get eaten by a kobold, but after years of being asleep, I have a new appreciation for feeling alive. And for all the chaos, there are game-like rules and magical powers that could help me avoid becoming a meal and perhaps even thrive in this hellscape.</p> <p>But first I'll have to find the tenacity to survive, the courage to fight, and the strength to face some dark truths about myself. Whispered voices call me the Hope of Humanity, but it turns out I might be the villain of this story.</p>";
