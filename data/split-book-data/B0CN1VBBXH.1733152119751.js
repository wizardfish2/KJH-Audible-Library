And the Azure Dragon stirs in the empire’s capital.<br> <br> With the arrival of winter, Lu Jie’s workload has continued to increase. Now in charge of an entire sect, and mired in politics, he’d been expecting constant pushback from demonic beasts and yet … the demons seem to have vanished without a trace.<br> <br> Left with a foreboding feeling, Lu Jie’s problems still haven’t solved themselves. <br> <br> The Alchemy Halls continue to put pressure and threaten him, all the while an invite has arrived from the Jade Court, calling him to Azure city. But Lu Jie has a plan, one that can not only protect him, but change the very course of history forever.<br> <br> It was time to leave his mark on the empire, once and for all.<br> <br> Book three of an epic Xianxia cultivation series perfect for fans of Beware of Chicken and Cradle. The series features weak-to-strong power progression, a light scientific approach to magic, tons of alchemy, spirit beast companions, and so much more.</p>";
