window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Mage-King of Mars is dead. Chaos rocks Olympus Mons. A new monarch must rise - but she does not stand alone! </b></p> <p>As the celebration of the victory at Legatus cools, a shuttle accident claims the lives of the Mage-King of Mars and his heir. The Crown and the Mountain fall to the Mage-King’s daughter, 16-year-old Kiera Alexander. She recalls Damien Montgomery, her father’s First Hand, to stand as her Lord Regent.&nbsp;</p> <p>The pair are unprepared to govern but are thrust into the heart of Protectorate politics as the Mage-King had left behind everything from an unfinished war to an incomplete new Constitution.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even as they get a handle on the list Kiera’s father left them, Damien is grimly certain of one thing: when it comes to the deaths of Kings, he doesn’t believe in <i>accidents</i>.</p>";
