Legends fight for them.</b></p> <p>Harper thought retirement meant hanging up his glaive, but when the Dungeon Lord offers him something no adventurer has ever been given—a chance to build a sanctuary from the ground up—he can't resist. Finally, a quest where success means creation, not destruction.</p> <p>What starts as empty land on the tenth floor of the dungeon and desperate refugees becomes something extraordinary. Olivie creates belonging with every warm smile and shared meal while Andrea challenges him at every turn. And through it all, Mel, his devoted pixie partner who masks a century of loyalty behind rural charm and feigned indifference, remains his unshakeable right hand. With every foundation laid and every heart opened, Harper discovers he's not just building a town. He's building a family.</p> <p>But Haven's Rest isn't just walls and workshops. It's monster folk who've never had someone fight for them instead of against them. The dark season approaches, and Haven's Rest isn't ready. Can Harper build fast enough to save the family he never knew he wanted?</p>";
