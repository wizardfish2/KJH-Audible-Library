Not for James Anderson.</b></p> <p>After being thrown into an isolated training realm, he is quick to figure out that there is no tutorial. No guidance. No ancient being to fully unlock his system. For eons he remains stuck by himself. Only system notifications and rewards appearing out of thin air keep him from going insane.</p> <p>But even that eventually stops working.</p> <p><b>Standing at the precipice of the Isolated Realm, he closes his eyes and jumps.</b></p> <p>A tear in reality opens under his feet, unbeknownst to him. It dumps him into a cultivation world gone awry. Demons and evil cultivators now dominate the world. Righteous sects and clans hole up in caves and array-defended mountain peaks.</p> <p><i>Why do they hide? Well, let's just say James has something to do with it.</i></p> <p>Follow James Anderson, or is it Yin Hu, as he is dragged into petty squabbles and the lives of the last remaining Hu Family members; Hu Shui and Hu Jun.</p> <p>Will he achieve his ultimate dream? Will there finally be his dream lady to pamper him after eons of struggling? Or maybe he should begin a harem-chasing adventure?</p> <p>Follow James (Yin Hu) as he navigates the world with the belief he isn't that strong.</p>";
