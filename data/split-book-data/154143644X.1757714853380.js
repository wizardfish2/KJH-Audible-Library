It certainly doesn't feel like that to Clyde, who's still got a day job scraping mud (at least he hopes it's mud) out of monster pits, and whose \"thieves' guild\" is more concerned with baking cookies than with protecting him against a rival gang.

Clyde really hopes Careena is right about him - the fate of the entire Empire depends on it.</p>";
