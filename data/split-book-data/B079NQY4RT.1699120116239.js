The greater concern now is whether any enemies of the US might have supernaturals and, if so, how to deal with them.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Missy enjoys day-to-day life back at the academy until learning a mob war puts some of her friends at risk; she once again confronts the local crime boss, only to end up helping him. Thank goodness she has discovered a new and unique special ability which she can use. Then, that ability becomes especially needed when terrorist threats against some target cities in the US are discovered.</p>";
