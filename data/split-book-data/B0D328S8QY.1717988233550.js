And if you're a newcomer, buckle up for an unforgettable rollercoaster ride.</p> <p>Born one of the Powered in a world starving for superhuman defenders, Boyd is both blessed and cursed—blessed in that he was born Powered, possessing superpowers on a world in desperate need of each Hero able to defend humanity from a hostile planet, but cursed in that he is one of the Changed. The Changed are those Powered who were transformed into creatures from long-dead Old Earth’s myths and legends. Changed have the unfortunate tendency to behave exactly as they appear.

Love's initial spark reveals a startling truth – he's an Enhancer, wielding a power that demands a heavy toll. Grappling with a mentor's spiteful influence, Boyd finds his path strewn with insurmountable challenges.
