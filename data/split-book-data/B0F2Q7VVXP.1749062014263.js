Three months after being thrust into a world of ki, monsters, and relentless danger, Eric finds himself stronger, smarter, and more determined—but far from safe.</p> <p></p> <p>Now a Foundation Realm Cultivator, Eric’s quest for survival has evolved into a mission to uncover the mysteries of the corrupted ki threatening this world. Joined by his fiercely loyal spirit beast, Nimbus, and unlikely allies, Eric must face challenges that push his limits—both physically and mentally.</p> <p></p> <p>The path to power is fraught with peril: corrupted beasts that defy nature, shadowy figures manipulating ki in unimaginable ways, and the looming influence of the gods themselves. As Eric navigates the dangerous political games of the Sects and his own growing abilities, he discovers that his knack for manipulating ambient ki is more than just a quirk—it’s a game-changing ability that could redefine cultivation as the world knows it.</p> <p></p> <p>But power always comes with a price, and Eric must decide how far he’s willing to go to protect this world—and the people he’s come to care about.</p> <p></p> <p>Will he rise above the corruption, or will it consume him before he can reach his true potential?</p>";
