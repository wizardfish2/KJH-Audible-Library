Welcome to The Game.”</p> <p>The heliopause protected Earth, keeping us safe from a violent galaxy.</p> <p>Or so we thought.</p> <p>Who knew it did more than keep us guarded? Who understood that its integrity was the only thing holding our beginner’s protection in place? If we'd known—if we’d understood, we’d have waited longer, a hell of a lot longer to pierce its veil.</p> <p>But when the USM Arrowheart passed through it and left our solar system, that protection ended and all hell broke loose.</p> <p>The aliens who'd been watching, waiting, and biding their time were ready. We weren’t.</p> <p>But there was hope. The first human to leave the universe will forever become the Sentinel of Earth.</p> <p>The Sentinel was gifted everything needed to defend Earth, to understand The Game, and to provide Earth’s population with a fighting chance. Only one question remained: Will he be able to adapt while protecting Earth or will the vast changes be insurmountable?</p>";
