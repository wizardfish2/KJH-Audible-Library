But there is a reason the former War God fell. He can only dare to imagine what foes lie in wait. He will have to build a team out of a former shield maiden, an elven sorceress intent on hiding her power, a beautiful lycan who doesn't trust anyone, and a mortal-hating fire celestial. What could be hard about that?</p> <p><i>This book contains some adult content and is intended for a mature audience. </i></p>";
