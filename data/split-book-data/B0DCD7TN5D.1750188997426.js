window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Will Kaufman is the face of a galactic rebellion. Now, he just has to win the war.</b></p> <p>As a coalition of species and planets fights to unseat the Imperium, Will, the only human on the Coalition War Council, is put forward as an unlikely poster boy for galactic harmony. His unremarkable home world and its unimportant species—humans—have come to the aid of a greater galaxy they didn't even know existed.</p> <p>With each battle won, breaking the shackles of the Imperium seems not only possible but inevitable… until old grievances and simmering rivalries spring up among the Coalition.</p> <p>Lurking behind it all is Prefect Tror and his seemingly indestructible flagship, the <i>ONE</i>. With it, the Imperium begins to create a political wedge capable of tipping the balance in its favor. It doesn't take a Foris AI to know that the Imperium must be defeated, fully and completely, if the galaxy is to have any hope of freedom.</p> <p>Such a victory can only happen if Will can keep a splintered rebellion focused on the war, but stubborn grudges threaten to drag even the crew of the <i>Phaelon </i>into disarray.</p> <p>The war is at its climax and Will Kaufman is…</p> <p>The hero of the rebellion!</p>";
