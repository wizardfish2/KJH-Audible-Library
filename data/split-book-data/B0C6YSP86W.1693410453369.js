window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sarah snuffed it, expired, breathed her last breath—also known as died, if you need it spelled out—in the most unlikely of places…the library. But do not fret! This is perfectly normal.</p> <p>What is not normal, however, is the persistence of one’s soul after shuffling off this mortal coil.</p> <p>To break the Cycle is strange and wrong and perverse. It goes against the very nature of existence: lives must eventually be recycled (responsibly).</p> <p>Lucky or unlucky, Sarah finds herself Cycle-broken and very much alive, depending on how strict you wish to be with that definition. Turns out, heaven has a return policy better than Costco. And souls are terribly expensive. So if Sarah doesn’t win some forthcoming contests, she is to be flushed back to the Primordial Sea of Souls, back to the Cycle to eventually be reincarnated as whatever the RNG gods have in store for her. A slug, most likely.</p> <p>Join Sarah on her crazy and hilarious adventure into a new fantasy world, where she learns to swear, kill cute monsters, and fight for her survival.</p>";
