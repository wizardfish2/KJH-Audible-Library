Orphaned and living with his grandparents, he's given up on college in favor of working at the Coney Island Home Depot while pining for Sally, his cool, beautiful colleague.</p> <p>But it's hard to ignore the news of dungeons opening up all over the country, in both cities and across lonely stretches of rural land. Mutated rats, crocodiles, and spiders pour out of them to face off against mankind, and all that stands in their way is the Awakeners, people who, in moments of great stress, are able to tap into the mana that now pulsates throughout the world.</p> <p>When James receives the System message that he'll join their ranks, naturally he's thrilled. The Awakeners live like kings in powerful guilds and are solely responsible for humanity's survival. Ever since his father—who worked for a mysterious agency—passed away, he's wanted to follow in his footsteps to improve society. This is his chance to make that dream come true.</p> <p>But when James joins the Awakeners Association, it quickly becomes apparent that not all is as it seems. The bureaucratic institution is weakening, and fraud and corruption are rife, while a conspiracy sprawls through the most powerful guilds. Meanwhile, Sally's ex, Callum, is hot on his tail. Oh, and a dungeon is opening under Manhattan. As James develops his skills, he'll have to be quick—and smart—to stay alive.</p> <p><b>The hit LitRPG adventure—with more than a million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
