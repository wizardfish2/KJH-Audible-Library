Sure, there are a few Half-Elves around, but after the last war, even their kind had become a rare sight indeed.</p> <p>But Lemmy, as his friends call him, is pretty well-integrated into the human world. As a seasoned adventurer, raised by humans, he never really questioned his origins all that much. That is, until Golariel, the reclusive High Elven Queen of the Silver Court reaches out to him in his dreams and tells him of a destiny much bigger and more exciting than anything he'd ever dreamt up on his own.</p> <p>Can Lemmy help save his people from extinction and find love and adventure deep in Sylvan territory? Will he discover the truth of his own origins and what his future holds? And what is he going to do about the quirky Half-Elven priestess of Tellithri who keeps following him around?</p>";
