Invaluable resources, and more importantly, the power to control the dungeon itself, stands as more than an enticing reward to lure Cade in.</p> <p>The beasts of Antinium have mutated and turned from a nuisance into a full-scale threat. But most concerning of all is the evil that festers in the darkness. For the sake of Antinium's people, the rulers of Last World must prove that the light of their newly forged society is enough to withstand the night....</p> <p><b>The Chimera King series contains explicit adult content, unconventional harem relationships, graphic and persistent violence, and a hero whose humor belongs in a military barracks.
