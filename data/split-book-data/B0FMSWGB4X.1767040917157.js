window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Have you ever woken up, rolled over, and thought to yourself, \"I'm pretty sure I'm working for a supervillain?\"</b></p> <p>If you haven't, then maybe you're not the type of person to work for a global corporation.</p> <p>Edmund, however, is exactly that kind of person. He had worked for Legion and for his mentor and savior, Felix Campbell.</p> <p>Now, though, Edmund is working for himself—and for the universe as a whole. He's leaving everything he knew, everyone he knows, to set out into the literal unknown. Which essentially means Edmund will be working for himself without any fallback. No safety net, and nothing and no one to swoop in and save him if he fails. A lot like opening your own company or business, really.</p> <p>All of those fears of failure are mostly irrelevant to Edmund, though. He'll work and do all he can to make sure they succeed regardless. Because he has already achieved the \"Good Ending\" and the \"Bad Ending.\" Explored the ends of both sides of the story—how things rolled out and where they terminated. All while he mapped out the variables, the changes, the shifts—and where it all ended.</p> <p>Now, it's time to push forward and reach the \"Best Ending.\"</p> <p>The perfect route is clear, and everything that entails—righting every wrong and forcibly correcting even the worst mistakes others made. From his little sister to the god Runner himself, and everything in between. Because Edmund is the Save State Hero—and he's the only one who can do this.</p>";
