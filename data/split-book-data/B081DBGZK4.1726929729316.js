window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For John, death was merely the beginning.</b><br> </p> <p>After saying goodbye to his life on earth, he never expected to find a brand new world still awaiting for him.<br> </p> <p>One where immortals flew through the clouds and ancient evils hid below the surface.<br> </p> <p>One where fables, myths, and legends filled every corner.<br> </p> <p>One where he could finally start anew.<br> </p> <p>Now, however, John is about to learn a valuable lesson, for any place humanity rules will always be the same - a domain where sin and ambition can only be tamed by power.<br> </p> <p>Will he have the strength to walk this road on his own or will he be unable to heal the old wounds hidden deep within his heart?<br> </p> <p>Find out by listening to <i>The Idle System</i><br> </p> <p>This book contains a story of self-discovery, ambition, and revenge. Inspired by classical LitRPG and Xianxia, it's a new take on the genres. Containing romance without harem elements, <i>The Idle System</i> isn't a novel for the weak of heart, but one for those enamored with planetary-levels of destruction. If the aforementioned tropes are to your taste, don't hesitate to buy this bundle.</p> <p>This volume contains the first four novels in The Idle System series: <i>The New Journey</i>, <i>The Rogues</i>, <i>The Birth </i>and <i>The Sins</i>, all of which are available separately.</p>";
