Mari’s only hope for freedom is to be granted asylum from the leaders of the powerful Star Kingdom. First, she must prove that she has knowledge and resources she can offer them. Second, she has to earn their trust.</p> <p>This all would have been easier if her people hadn’t bombed their planet....</p> <p><i>Asylum</i> is a stand-alone novel in the Star Kingdom universe.
