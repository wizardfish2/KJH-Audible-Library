window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When I left my old life behind, I thought I’d seen the worst of it. Turns out, I was wrong.</b></p> <p>Six months after discovering I’m a Warlock, surviving my first semester at a magic college filled with witches, and forming a coven with my roommate, things are getting complicated.</p> <p>Just as I’m starting to make sense of Willowmere and the Witch Families that want me bound to them—or dead—Morgan, the closest thing I had to family in foster care, shows up. Only she’s got magic of her own. Now, between trying to figure out how to keep her safe, discovering the dark forces targeting my classmates, and keeping my coven together, life has officially reached a new level of weird.</p> <p>At least I’m not alone. With my witch, Samantha, by my side and Melaina, my ancient, powerful (and frustratingly attractive) mentor, guiding me, I’m building a coven strong enough to keep the Families at bay. But as I delve deeper into the dark force targeting Willowmere, the lines between love, power, and loyalty blur as my coven grows in unexpected ways, adding an internal battle for us to face.</p>";
