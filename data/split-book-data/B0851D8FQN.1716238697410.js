window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Steve doesn’t know who he was. He does know a lot more than he did previously, though. He’s in a country called Lamals where men are required to have children, then more often than not, go fight and die. And that’s just how it is.</p> <p>Things are at least improving, though. Steve successfully put a stop to the Creep’s advance. He’d buried it under a mountain of broken wall and escaped with his life. Which eliminates one enemy. The creep and its undead.</p> <p>Now, he only has to worry about bandits, the military, the country of Lamals, and other people.</p> <p>With that problem nearly solved, Steve can worry about problems closer to home. After all, his only true concerns are about his farm and his family. That’s all he really needs. Everyone else are little better than a resource to be utilized.</p> <p>Unfortunately, things still aren’t what they seem to be. The messages Steve left himself pointed at something beyond their contents. Now, that \"something more\" is about to make contact with him. On top of that, the farm is going to hit capacity eventually. Especially if one factored into it that Steve was likely going to have children at some point in the future.</p> <p>Family troubles and more problems than he could expect are about to find Steve. Shooting up as if they were trees grown with his over-powered watering can.</p> <p>Good thing Steve has his axe. Any problem can be solved with it...with the right application of force.</p> <p><b>Warning: </b>This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show. Listen at your own risk. This story is an adult fantasy novel.</p>";
