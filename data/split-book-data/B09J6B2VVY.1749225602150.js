window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Zac Riggs would not have survived on Ludus for very long without his adopted sister, Gazra-tam. Gazra-tam is an ocelot-race Mo'hali, and Riggs is an engineering student from Earth who was transported to Ludus. The two make an unlikely team.<br> <br> Riggs and his sister had been comfortable living in a trap-filled dungeon before bandits attacked. But now there are bodies all over the floor and it doesn't quite feel like home anymore.<br> <br> The time has come for Gazra-tam to lead Riggs out of the wilderness to a city. Ludus is full of dangers, but the two are not defenseless. Riggs has budding, if underwhelming, magical powers, and his sister is good with a spear. Hopefully it will be enough.<br> <br> Adventure awaits...whether they're ready or not. But with danger comes opportunity, too.<br> <br> And if Riggs can figure out how to use his engineering know-how on a fantasy world full of magic and monsters, it might give him exactly the edge that he needs.</p>";
