One that he sought out after he’d come back from his tour of duty.</p> <p>A detective in the paranormal investigations department. A job he could work day in and day out in relative peace. One cold and forgotten cup of coffee at a time. </p> <p>It was an environment that made some sense to him. At least in comparison to civilian life where almost nothing did. On top of that, it gave him a chance to hide what he was from the rest of the world. </p> <p>An apex predator that made the entirety of the paranormal world fear him. His very species was often killed as soon as they were found out. </p> <p>By government and citizen alike. </p> <p>He’s a Boogieman. </p> <p>A name that made humans laugh, and vampires curse. It was a strange life to be sure. </p> <p>Now though, Gus’s stable non-life is about to be kicked over. Whether he likes it or not, he’s about to be handed a case that’s going to mess up his already screwed up life.</p>";
