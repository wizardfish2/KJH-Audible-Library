window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>All it takes is one bad card to screw the whole game...and Murf just pulled one hell of a bad card!</p> <p>Murf is a professional gambler, a confessed liar and thief. He's a coward who's known to be overly friendly to other men's wives and daughters, and he's fled more than one town just a step ahead of people who want his head on a pole--or something much more painful. Cards are his life and livelihood, but he's never taken one of the Unity's magic cards into his soul to become a Holder because honestly, it seems like a horrible way to live to him.</p> <p>At least, he hadn't until that choice was taken from him, and the Mother of the damn Deck planted herself inside him.</p> <p>All Murf wanted was to play some cards, win some money, and maybe enjoy the company of some women with fairly loose morals. Instead, he's got bounty hunters after him, Holders who want to kill him, and some shadowy villain who wants the card that he's got stuck inside him. And all because he drew one bad card...</p> <p>Murf's Laws is a card-based LitRPG series. It's got mild profanity, a fair bit of violence, non-explicit amorous encounters, and an MC with a dirty mind and matching sense of humor. And, as Millie keeps insisting, \"No harems!\"</p>";
