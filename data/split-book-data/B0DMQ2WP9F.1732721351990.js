window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ilea is going home. <i>After </i>a small detour to raid an old Necromancer’s treasure room.</p> <p>After months in the barren and deadly North, Ilea returns to Ravenhall to rest, check-in on old friends, and of course–train her resistances. Her homecoming includes a visit to Riverwatch where she encounters new allies… and old enemies. But what would a good holiday be without a few fights and near-death experiences?</p> <p>Unfortunately, Ilea’s blood-soaked reunions are cut short when she is summoned back to Hallowfort, to help deal with a sinister corruption that is spilling out from the first layer of the Descent.</p> <p>Searching for a lost expedition, Ilea explores an ancient dungeon host to long-forgotten secrets. She will be pushed to her limit and face dangers that no one in their right mind would dare to stand against.</p> <p>Sounds like fun, right?</p> <p><b>About the series:</b></p> <p>Join Ilea as she is transported to a world full of monsters and magic, where power is measured by one's class, level and skills. Watch her grow in power, and recklessness, as she wields ancient hand-to-hand combat magic that can both heal and destroy. This Isekai story has a dual-Class LitRPG system where every skill, class and ability can evolve. Ilea’s tale is equal parts comfy slice-of-life wanderings, goofy jokes and brutal, blood-pumping battles with nightmarish monsters. Join her as she delves into forgotten dungeons, hoards snacks and generally does whatever she feels like.</p>";
