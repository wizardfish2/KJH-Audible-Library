window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After narrowly surviving my debut into the magical world, I made a promise to myself: no more hiding in broom closets.<br> But with the Mages’ Guild reorganizing faster than anyone thought possible, and naming me as their number one target, that promise seems a little far-fetched. Especially since my training with Callie and Dizzy, the highly experienced dual-mage pair, goes off like a cake in a cannon.</p> <p>Left to find someone that can fill the role, it isn’t until a formal dinner party goes horribly wrong that I find the best (and worst) solution imaginable: Reagan Somerset, the leather-clad crazy woman who busted into my broom closet sanctuary in the first place.</p> <p>Through an off-kilter teaching style and many punches in the face, I learn my true potential.</p> <p>But with her happier busting heads and kicking in doors than staying put with a pupil in hiding, it isn’t long before the world comes crashing down. The Guild has found me, and they intend to take me alive.</p> <p>Magical Mayhem Trilogy 2.</p> <p>Performed by Renee Dorian, Alyssa Keegan, Robb Moreira, Julie Hoverson, Gabriel Michael, Carolyn Kashner, Nanette Savard, Terence Aselford, Rob McFadyen, Jenna Sharpe, Lise Bruneau, Tyler Hyrchuk, James Konicek, Rose Elizabeth Supan, Ken Jackson, James Lewis, Daniel Llaca, Scott McCormick, Mark Harrietha, Thomas Penny, Joe Mallon, Michael John Casey, T.
