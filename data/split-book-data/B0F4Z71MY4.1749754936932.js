It may fall on one to do just that.</p> <p>After thousands of people suddenly vanish from Earth, former gymnast Jade Callian finds herself thrust into an endless dungeon filled with magic, monsters, and far too few instructions. When Jade receives a mortal wound soon after her arrival in this new world, she is forced to pick a new race that has the power to save her. There's just one problem: Her only choice is to turn into a succubus.</p> <p>If she wants to protect her home Jade will have to defy her demonic instincts, find trusted companions, battle monsters, and unravel the dangerous mysteries surrounding this ancient labyrinth. She just wishes that she had more than demon seduction magic to help her.</p> <p>Oh well. At least she got to pick her class.</p>";
