How hard could meeting the parents be?</b></p> <p>Turns out when your girlfriends include a princess, a dragon-blooded noble, a monster hunter from a legendary family, and a demonic duchess, \"meeting the family\" involves a lot more than awkward small talk over dinner.</p> <p>But holiday drama takes a backseat when revolutionaries start bombing the capital of Umbrica. Someone's smuggling infernal weapons into Caldia—the same demon-forged horrors I spent years fighting in the war. Worse, they're planning something big enough to tear the Free States apart, and all signs point to treachery.</p> <p>Now I'm racing against time while my blood magic screams at me to let loose the monster I used to be. The girls at my side are ready to fight for me and for Caldia, but this isn't an academy training exercise—this is the kind of battle people don't come back from, and nothing is as it seems.</p> <p><b>The war may be over, but the fight for the people I love is just beginning.</b></p>";
