With determination to get either a dragon's egg or a dragon, Waldo sets out. He is soon face-to-face with the red dragon Luna, and she is...not quite what he expected. Waldo knew reaching his final goal would be hard, but the obstacles prove to be rather unique. But when has that ever stopped Waldo?</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in Alteroth, Lilith Corpselover is going to war! It is the opening engagement of what will be the largest war in 2,000 years.
