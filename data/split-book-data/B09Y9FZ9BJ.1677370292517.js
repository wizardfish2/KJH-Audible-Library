Not anymore.</p> <p>For more than 150 years I've served the Kingdom of Sena. Through four kings and a queen. Two wars and a rebellion. I've founded and taught at a magic school. I've fought against beast waves and dungeon breaks.</p> <p>But now? Now, the one close friend I had left has passed. So, I'm done with their politics and their economics. The short and busy lives of humans are more burden than benefit on the weary soul of this half-elf.</p> <p>Now, I'm looking for a refuge, a place that can well and truly be my own. Away from the growing cities and the bustling markets, away from the pointless wars, away from the eager students and the arrogant adventurers.</p> <p>I'm seeking the peaceful life of a wizard in his tower, studying magic to advance my spellcraft.... We'll see if that happens.</p> <p><b>Experience the start of a LitRPG epic from Gregory Allanther, the best-selling author of </b><b><i>An Old Man's Journey</i></b><b>.</b></p>";
