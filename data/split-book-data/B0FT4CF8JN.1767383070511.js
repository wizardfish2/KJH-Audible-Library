Especially since now is the time to get to know his newest companion better as Samira happily burrows her way into everyone’s hearts with a smile.</p> <p>While many remain snug within their homes, Koda works determinedly to do all he can to ensure his tribe’s survival. Whether that be winter hunting, bringing in more wood for the fires, or making one last trip into the plains between storms to meet with the Silent Plains tribe.</p> <p>After all, while winter is a time of calm and warm fires, it is also the time when most tribes can sit, talk, and spread information. So Koda needs to make a good impression so that can spread along their lines of communication, and a bit of snow is no match for Aegisclaw and his mates. And things have been quiet from his goddess for a while, which puts Koda on edge.</p> <p>Most spend their time in peace, others take the time to plan—for good or ill—regarding the coming spring and the opportunities that await them.</p>";
