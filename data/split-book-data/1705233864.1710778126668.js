She's a dragon.</p> <p>And dragonkind will never be the same.</p> <p>She's achieved some mastery over her powers and even defeated an enemy dragon.</p> <p>But nothing she has done has prepared her for what's coming next. Kristen has been invited to join Dragon SWAT - a force of dragons which serves to keep order among their species. But not every dragon is happy with the status quo; some see humanity as a threat which should be eliminated. They're not alone.
