window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a city where the supernatural dances with the mundane, a dragon's justice burns brighter than dragon fire. Beelzebub, the Prince of Hell's audacity to wreak havoc in Zach's turf—and bring the FBI's fury down on the dragon king—will not be forgotten. It's time for payback.</p> <p>It isn't just for Beelzebub, but for Sabrina as well. The succubus is losing herself and needs an infusion from more powerful demons if she's to remain the woman Zach knows.</p> <p>But Hell, as it happens, is no simple battlefield. It's a treacherous labyrinth where every corner seethes with the politics of demon princes. In their ruthless games, they see Zach not as a foe to be feared, but as a pawn to be maneuvered.</p> <p>Yet, within this intricate web of deception and power, Ikta dances to her own tune. With her whimsical flair for chaos, she's there to flip the board and turn the game on its head.</p> <p>Brace yourselves for a tale that plunges you into the heart of a dragon's fury and the labyrinthine depths of Hell's intrigues. Because when you play with fire, even a dragon can get burnt.</p>";
