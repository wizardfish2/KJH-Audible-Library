Well, his second chance has arrived.</b></p> <p>Garth had been the favorite for the number-one draft pick in the next season of the USA's top sport.

To make Garth the new captain of the New Arcadia Phoenixes.</p> <p>There's just one awkward sticking point in the contract—his three teammates are all absurdly attractive monster girls in need of therapy, and he's the one providing it.</p>";
