A mystery that will change the world forever.</b></p> <p>No sooner had Thorn stepped into his new role as Titan of Earth than the enemies of the Duchy pounced, their armies flooding into Ironhold. With barely enough time to plan their defense, Thorn and the Wolfkin are forced into battle against forces that outnumber them five to one.</p> <p>To make matters worse, other guilds who have long eyed Nova Lunaâ€™s position, are eager to cut Thorn and his friends down to size. Hemmed in by enemies on every side, the only way to overcome this world shaking challenge is to cut straight through it.</p> <p>Thorn has come far since he first logged into Nova Terra. He has gained overpowered abilities and forged strong alliances, but even he is not sure if his titanic strength will be sufficient to hold Angoril together. Regardless of what happens, Nova Terra will never be the same.</p> <p><i>Nova Terra: Worldbearer</i> is the tenth book in the Titan Series, a GameLit/LitRPG series.</p>";
