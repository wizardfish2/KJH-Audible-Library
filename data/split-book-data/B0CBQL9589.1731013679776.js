Joined by a sly Demoness with an ancient past and a shy Valkyrie hoping to prove herself in battle, they'll find excitement and enjoyment as they level and grow in power.</p> <p>Will Jake be strong enough to face the challenges of an evil labyrinth, or will he die and be separated from his new family forever, waiting to respawn in the void?</p> <p>Bonded Summoner Book 1 has already been enjoyed on RoyalRoad and Scribblehub, with over 350,000 views between the two platforms. What are you waiting for?</p> <p>Contains: LitRPG system, crafting, cultivation, dungeon crawling, dating, and an infinite universe.</p>";
