It's that she's constantly having to conceal her adult intellect, which is not only advanced but <i>otherworldly.</i></p> <p>Sure, being a young woman and a grad student in twenty-first-century America had its challenges, but this life as Lillith presents even tougher obstacles. She must tread carefully to conceal her vast knowledge of biology, math, physics, and . . . being an adult. Because who'd expect a child to understand the complexities of this world, let alone an entirely different one? Certainly not the unassuming family young Lillith was born into.</p> <p>In this new world she must claim as her own, she's expected to obey her parents, worship a god, and respect a monarchy. But with the memories, experiences, and convictions of both Annie and Lillith combined, she knows she can't—won't—abide by any of it. Until she learns mages play an important role in this society, and her fate as Lillith is suddenly a bit more appealing . . .</p> <p>Now, teaching herself everything she can about mages—spellcasters and this world's rulers—Lillith has big plans, the kind that could change this realm for the better. But her scheming isn't without risk. As she grows older, she'll need to make crucial decisions about who to enlist to help her, who she can trust, and what she can accomplish with her self-taught magic.</p> <p>Her plan is bold, brash, and possibly impossible. But Lillith is willing to try, danger be damned.</p> <p><b>The first volume of this isekai adventure series—with almost a million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
