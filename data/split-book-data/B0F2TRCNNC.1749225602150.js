window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After her near-fatal journey into the Descent, Ilea returns south to check on her allies and lay some groundwork for unlocking her elusive third Class.<br> <br> Trian is ready to start training the first generation of Medic Sentinels, the battle-healers of their newly founded organization, and Ilea is happy to join in as a teacher (of sorts). Hopefully, her work will pay off in the birth of at least a few mini-versions of herself.<br> <br> By day, Ilea teaches the Sentinels her way of fighting and training (resistances), and by night, she applies the principles to herself. She explores supposedly very dangerous dungeons in the south and exposes herself to all manner of magics and traps, as every increased skill and resistance will help prepare her for the coming of her third class.<br> <br> It is a good routine; as long as she has mana to heal, the numbers will go up.<br> <br> However, all good grinding sessions must come to an end, the invitation of a powerful order soon pulls her back into the conflicts of humanity and beyond. With new powers and allies, she flies into a kingdom on the losing side of a war and finds things are not quite as they seem...<br> <br> Perhaps punching a lot of things really hard will once again prove to be a viable solution.</p> <p>--</p> <p><b>About the series:</b><br> <br> Join Ilea as she is transported to a world full of monsters and magic, where power is measured by one's class, level and skills. Watch her grow in power, and recklessness, as she wields ancient hand-to-hand combat magic that can both heal and destroy. This Isekai story has a dual-Class LitRPG system where every skill, class and ability can evolve. Ilea’s tale is equal parts comfy slice-of-life wanderings, goofy jokes and brutal, blood-pumping battles with nightmarish monsters. Join her as she delves into forgotten dungeons, hoards snacks and generally does whatever she feels like.</p>";
