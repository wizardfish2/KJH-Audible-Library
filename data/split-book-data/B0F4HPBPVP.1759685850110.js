But when the fleet was violently and unexpectedly thrown off course, the colonists found themselves trapped in an unexplored region of the galaxy—and caught right in the middle of a bloody interstellar war.</p> <p>Now, after generations of relentless fighting, a tentative truce has finally ushered in an era of growth and prosperity. Yet as hardline forces on all sides conspire to break the ceasefire, humanity finds itself in need of a new type of soldier—one who can win the peace even while the galaxy arms for war.</p> <p>Major Kal Zeris is the next generation of Dominion trooper, a powerful psionic soldier capable of withstanding—and dishing out—superhuman amounts of punishment. Born naturally on a crime-infested border world, Kal has learned to do whatever it takes to survive. But when he finds himself paired up with a sheltered young fleet cadet, he quickly learns that despite what her flawless, genetically engineered body may have given her in looks and smarts, there is no replacement for good, old-fashioned experience—on the battlefield or in the bedroom. And luckily for her, Kal is eager and willing to help with both.</p> <p>Together, they must unravel a conspiracy that threatens to end the peace—and destroy the Lost Fleet before it can find its way home.</p>";
