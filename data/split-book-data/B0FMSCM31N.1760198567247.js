And a woman just hatched from an egg.</b></p> <p>Life was finally starting to feel normal—if running a monster-filled farm with two girlfriends and an army of talking puppets could ever be considered normal.</p> <p>Then a stranger showed up—a beautiful girl begging for access to Sam’s personal dungeon. As if things weren’t already complicated, now the dungeon is glitching. Volatile floors, erratic bosses, and corrupted loot? Just another day in Amberglow.</p> <p>Luckily, Sam’s not alone. Chomp, his best friend and fiercely loyal Sharkpuppy, is always by his side. His goth girlfriend Faryn still thinks he's her knight in denim armor, and the scatterbrained genius Maeve just wants to study the AI-turned-girl like she’s her latest experiment.</p> <p>The farm might be growing, but so are the complications.</p> <p>And this time, ignoring the AI isn’t an option.</p>";
