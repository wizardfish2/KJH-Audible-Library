This time, he's ended up in another worldâ€”the world of the Spirits and Fae. The General has already been here before, but he's never tried to do something as audacious as stealing a treasure from one of the Queens.</p> <p>What will this latest adventure lead to? Will everything end here, in failure? Without the support of the mysterious and powerful Twilight Secrets Sect, the fight against the Raven Sect is doomed from the start . . . But their aid might just be too costly to attain.</p>";
