window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the blink of an eye the world changed.</p> <p>An experimental ASI with a terminal case of curiosity reached out and tampered with the universe in a way that it should not have, and unleashed a torrent of energy we would call magic into our galaxy.</p> <p>Humans, and every other intelligent lifeform for that matter, were ill-prepared, physically and mentally, for such an eventuality.</p> <p>In an effort to save itself, the ASI hastily created something it called the Framework to shape and codify this magical energy, and usher in a new world.</p> <p>A world of classes, levels, and extraordinary power. But also a world of monsters running rampant, violence, strife, and people's darkest urges given free rein. So it has been for those caught up in the Framework's web for thousands of years, and now it was Earth's turn.</p> <p>None of the above involved Torin Carter directly. The greatest challenge he faced had been the removal of an athletic scholarship due to a dogged shoulder injury.</p> <p>Paying the bills and finding a way to finish school is what worried him.</p> <p>He should have been a nobody, just another poor soul swallowed up and spat out by the crazy tumult of an RPG Apocalypse sweeping the planet.</p> <p>However, a clerical error, and a little bit of interference by interested parties, resulted in him being gifted with an amazing opportunity in this new world order. An extra powerful build, one not available to the rank and file of humanity.</p> <p>It does have one teeny-tiny drawback, though. The awesome character build he's gifted does mean his species is changed to something mildly demonic in nature. Which could be somewhat problematic.</p> <p>Plus, his new class is Dungeon Corsair Captain. As the name suggests he is not supposed to be the hero, the opposite in fact, he is supposed to be the villain. His class demands it.</p> <p>What will he do?</p> <p>Deny the opportunity and hope things work out as the world is torn apart, throw himself on the mercy of others. Or roll with it, take the bull by the horns and not just survive the coming cataclysm but thrive.</p> <p>Torin has never been a quitter and he really doesn't fancy dying. Option two it is.</p> <p>Welcome to the Darkwyrlds.</p> <p>You'll have the time of your life, or die trying.</p>";
