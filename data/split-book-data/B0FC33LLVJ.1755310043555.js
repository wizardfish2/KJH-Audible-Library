But at least people escaped the gruesome fate waiting at the hands of the Crooked. That was a good reward at least, right?</p> <p>Having two loving mates already in Sienna and Arthene, with a third working her way deeper into his heart by the day, it was high time for Koda to just focus on his lovers and finding his feet in this new world. Maybe move into that beautiful house that the people of Silverstone had gifted him and sleep in a bed that wasn’t in a tavern for once.</p> <p>But the reward for work done right is more work, sadly. Or in this case, someone from management poking their nose into things.</p> <p>And for once, this isn’t a problem Koda can solve by creative applications of force. He has to keep out of sight and away from Silverstone for a few days to a week or two. So instead, to help prepare for the oncoming winter, Koda and his team decide to head out into the open plains on a nice, quiet hunting trip.</p> <p>What kind of trouble could they get up to in the plains where the only occupants are a few roaming tribes and the great herds of bison?</p>";
