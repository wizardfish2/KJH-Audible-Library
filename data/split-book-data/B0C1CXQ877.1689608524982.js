Ancient terror surfacing.</b></p> <p>Felix and his people foiled the Hierocracy’s dire plans, freeing the Territory of Ahkestria and unleashing an ocean upon its sands in the process. Now he must reckon with the newfound political power in his hands, meddlesome nobility, and the Boon of a Primordial that has enacted changes on his very being.</p> <p>There’s one major difference this time: Felix is not the only one affected.</p> <p>His friends must learn to handle their sudden, intense gains while creatures from the deep—moved by a malevolent force known only as the Fathom—assault the city. Danger rises as the depths make their not-so-shallow moves. Felix has to deal with the consequences of his actions, which might cost him dearly.</p> <p>The only thing that would cost more? Doing nothing and hoping someone else would clean up his mess.</p>";
