window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>THE TALE OF A BOY, A FOX, AND A LOT OF ECCHI!</b></p> <p>Kevin Swift has the worst luck with women. It’s not that he’s unattractive or even unpopular. He just can’t talk to them. He blames it on all those shōnen romcoms he enjoys watching. Fortunately, or unfortunately―depending on who’s asking―Kevin’s love life is about to start looking up.</p> <p>After saving a fox’s life Kevin discovers that he actually rescued a Kitsune, a shape-shifter capable of transforming into a beautiful girl who appears to have popped right out of the pages to a Shōnen manga. Her name is Lilian, and she has decided that Kevin is going to be her mate, whether he wants to be or not.</p> <p>Between dealing with an overly amorous vixen, his inability to talk to girls, and school, Kevin is going to have his hands full.</p>";
