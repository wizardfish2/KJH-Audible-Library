And they need to get back to the Ice Dungeon—fast. Because Kalasi’s life is hanging by a thread, and if they don’t reach the Night Market in time, she might not survive.</p> <p>But with every dungeon step they take, the danger grows, and getting lost is a luxury they can’t afford. As enemies lurk in the shadows, Jay and the girls must face labyrinthine puzzles, monster-filled corridors, and Jay’s most terrifying challenge yet: trying to stay on Nova’s good side.</p> <p>Because if there’s one thing worse than a dungeon on the brink of collapse, it’s a sassy, unhinged dungeon spirit with abandonment issues.</p> <p>And let’s face it, Jay’s been dodging a lot of calls lately.</p>";
