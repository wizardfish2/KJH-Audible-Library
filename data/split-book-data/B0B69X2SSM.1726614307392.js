His girlfriend is lost in another dimension, his apartment’s been staked out by werewolves, and to top it all off, he’s flat broke.</p> <p>Too bad there’s no rest for the wicked. Monstrous beasts of biblical proportions have been unleashed upon the world, leaving Bill with a mighty big question—how the hell is one poor-ass vamp supposed to stop something the size of a battleship?</p> <p>All’s not lost, though. With a magic hammer by his side along with friends too stupid to quit, Bill will have to pierce the veil and explore a strange new world for answers. Success will mean saving everyone he knows, including his lost love.
