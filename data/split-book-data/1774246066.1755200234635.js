After they managed to rescue an innocent hostage from the clutches of two rival criminal cartels, they’ve gained a reputation with families who want to retrieve lost loved ones from places the authorities can’t go and with Fleet Intelligence.</p> <p>They are commissioned by an Intelligence agent to retrieve information from a cartel spy that could lead to the location of the Fleet cruiser <i>Metaurus</i>, thought lost in the war with the Tahni. A cartel ship has spotted it drifting through a distant system, far at the edge of occupied space, and Sandi and Ash are the only ones who can be trusted to investigate without throwing up red flags for the wrong people to see. But the <i>Metaurus </i>isn’t just a mystery...it’s a graveyard, its crew slaughtered. And the thing that did it isn’t human, and it isn’t dead.</p> <p><i>Exile</i>, book four</p> <p>Sandi, Ash, Korri, and Kan-Ten have worked openly as hired guns throughout the Pirate Worlds, fighting for lost causes and for each other. Covertly, they’ve worked as freelance operatives for Fleet Intelligence, sabotaging the schemes of cartel bosses and always running up against the plans of their nemesis, Jordi Abdullah, the head of the La Sombra cartel. </p> <p>Jordi is desperate and abandons his embattled home in the Pirate Worlds to try to create a new sanctuary for himself at the edge of Commonwealth civilization, on the Periphery world of Brigantia. His raiders have already cut the colony off from resupply, and now his agents are fomenting unrest between the human and Tahni populations in an attempt to destabilize the planetary government and take over.</p> <p>While Sandi and Ash hunt down the raider ships in the asteroid belt, Fontenot and Kan-Ten take on Jordi’s allies and pawns among the humans and the Tahni. On Brigantia, they encounter old friends and older enemies. The trick will be deciding which is which.</p>";
