The Dimensional Convergence begins as Grand Flaws appear in every direction for hundreds of miles, tearing apart the Western Reaches as demonic horrors trapped by the First War pour forth.

At the same time, the Boundless Alliance and the Cabal are plotting ways to escape from the world, the kingdom and Bloodline Clans are showing their true strength, and Outsider outposts across the world are reactivating, answering the call from forces beyond the Seal.</p> <p>Will the Lord of Silver Stars be able to protect his family, stabilize the World Seal, and find Asenya the World Forger, the only one who can fully repair the World Core? Although he discovers a clue to her location, she has been lost for tens of thousands of years.</p> <p>Primordial enchantments, crafting, and battles await in the sixth volume of this epic series!</p>";
