Their impossible aerobatics were bad enoughâ€”but then they started shooting at each other, and at the Navy, with nukes. Little ones at first, but winding up with a 500 megatonner at 90 miles that fried every piece of electronics within line-of-sight.</p> <p>Richard Ashton thought he was just a ringside observer of these now over-the-horizon events. Until the crippled alien lifeboat came drifting down and homed in on his sailboat. Suddenly he has his hands full of an unconscious, critically wounded, and impossibly human alien warrior who also happens to be a gorgeous female.</p> <p>That's when things got interesting.</p>";
