A new Lord rises.</b></p> <p>Felix has established a Stronghold within the Foglands, now called the Territory of Nagast—just as he is now called Autarch.

Finally, things are looking up.</p> <p>Yet dreams trouble Felix’s sleep. Dreams of fire and sand, wind and undeath. Of crimson armor and golden blades marching across scorched deserts half a Continent away. Among it all, constant and insistent, is need and fear in terrible measure as a figure fights for their very life.</p> <p>A familiar face—another Unbound.</p> <p>And he needs Felix’s help.</p>";
