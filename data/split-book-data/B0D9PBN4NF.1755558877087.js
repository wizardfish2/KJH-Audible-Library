window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two-edged sword…</b></p> <p>A gorgeous elf swordswoman bent on revenge in a kingdom where the sword is everything? Not what I had in mind when Brin, Tyra, Tip, and I went hunting more bad guys. But hey, did I mention the gorgeous elf woman?</p> <p>Sariel Snowblossom has a problem. One we can help her with. To get justice, she must undertake the trials to become a swordmaster. But it’s not as easy as it sounds.</p> <p>In addition to defeating skilled sword wielders all over the Aesturith Kingdom in a dueling circuit, there are other dangers about. Thugs, assassins, and umbrenix, just for starters, most of them set on preventing Sariel from getting to the next contest. Making it to the capital city for the final duel is a treacherous journey in itself, only for her to put her life on the line once again when we get there.</p> <p>We’ll do it, though. Not only so our sexy elf can complete her quest, but so we can get one step closer to destroying the demigod who took me from my world and killed my best friend.</p> <p>It’s just one more thing to deal with in this new world I’ve found myself in. We may be dueling and training all day long, but damn, the nights make it all worthwhile. I need to use my weapon as often as I can, after all.</p>";
