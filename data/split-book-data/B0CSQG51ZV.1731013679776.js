I am a veteran peacekeeper--once a one-armed, homeless, jobless father, now the first human ever to come into contact with the Precursors' Cube on Mars, and proud owner of the most combative hamster in the galaxy.</p> <p>The artifact is what brought me to Sidus, a mysterious space station at the center of the galaxy. A dozen or so alien civilizations have also found their way here, seemingly to unite against a common enemy. Or common enemies. Honestly, we don't know what it is that we need to face, for all the species on Sidus combined have barely explored a fraction of the galaxy. We can only guess at what other secrets are held by that dark, obscure expanse.</p> <p>It does hold something, that's for sure. Something sinister. And it's up to me to find out what.</p> <p>After all, I am the first, the protector of my kind.</p> <p>Before doing that, though, I need to tie my laces and swap out this crappy blaster for something a little more high-tech.</p>";
