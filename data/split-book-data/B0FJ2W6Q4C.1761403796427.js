They were armed with laser cannons, rockets, missiles, and heavy kinetic weapons more similar to artillery pieces than guns, and everything that went with that.</p> <p>Unfortunately, he had been declined military service. His only avenue left to become a Walker Pilot was to make it happen all on his own. And he did just that. He became a true Cavalier, was wounded, gained squad mates, and founded the House of Hesh.</p> <p>Now, the universe is shifting faster than Wayne can even keep up with. He freed his home world and became a national hero, only to find that what had been an opening move in his life, from going from a nobody to a somebody, was only the starting point to an \"interesting life.\"</p> <p>A war inside the Confed is brewing. One that is going to draw every corner of the Confed into it. Somehow, Wayne is already managing to put himself front and center for it. Both as a spectator...</p> <p>...and a Cavalier.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
