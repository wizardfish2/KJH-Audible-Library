Now he’s something else—faster, deadlier, and armed with a unique class built for one thing: hunting monsters.</p> <p>For ten years, he’s braved the frontier alone, cutting down every beast that threatens the border towns. With each kill, he’s grown stronger, gaining levels and sharpening his skills on the thousands of monsters infesting the wild lands.</p> <p>But something’s wrong. The monsters are coming faster, stronger, and Velik’s losing ground. The arrival of a guild hunter brings more complications, as the gold-ranked hunter seems more curious about Velik than the monsters he’s been hired to kill.</p> <p>With time running out, Velik must venture deeper into the woods, facing deadly creatures while searching for the source of the threat. But what he finds isn’t just a nest. It’s a secret—one that could explain what happened to Velik ten years ago.</p> <p>Something in the dark remembers him…and it’s been waiting.</p>";
