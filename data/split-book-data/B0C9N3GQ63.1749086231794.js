Mages and Archons create the only path forward.</b><br> <br> Tala has returned to her new home, her mission successful, and her money-pouch temporarily refilled. Gold is still an ever present concern, but more pressing hurdles lie before her. Her inscriptions have been renewed and completed, granting her newfound power that she must learn to control, and she has a long list of tasks to complete before she can join the ranks of the powerful Archons.<br> <br> As she delves deeper into the mysteries of the world, barely even hinted at by the Academy, Tala has discovered the secrets of the truly mighty: the creation of an Archon Star. The Mage isn't content to follow the standard path. She's determined to forge her Archon Star from an unconventional material, a gamble that could either lead to her triumph or her downfall.<br> <br> Tala isn't one to shy away from a challenge, but only time will reveal if her daring plan will pay off when it is time to complete her Binding.</p>";
