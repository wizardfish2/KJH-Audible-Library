window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Kelsey makes her big debut on the world stage in the second book of this dungeon-core fantasy adventure from the author of the Phantasm series.</b></p> <p>Traveling to distant, exotic lands and meeting interesting, exciting people is all part of Kelsey's gig as a dungeon. And if she has to kill someone, well . . . they probably had it coming. Ever at her—or at least her avatar's—side is the dependable Anton, and now he's leading her on a quest across the ocean to rescue his people from slavery.</p> <p>That doesn't mean Kelsey can neglect the home front though. Her putative liege, Suliel, has earned a telepathic link to her, allowing the dungeon to coordinate the development of the barony. At the same time, she needs to provide ships and explosives to Anton's team.</p> <p>He may have new members, new equipment, and a whole new Heroic Class, but Anton will face far greater challenges this time around, including possible death on a daily basis. He must make the difficult choices every hero faces, be they romantic or reckless, and needs Kelsey's support now more than ever.</p> <p>To keep the group together—and everyone more or less in one piece—they'll both face incredible obstacles and risk heartbreaking losses. But every step Anton takes on his path leads him closer to Kelsey's true goal.</p> <p><b>From the author of Phantasm: The second volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—originally released on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
