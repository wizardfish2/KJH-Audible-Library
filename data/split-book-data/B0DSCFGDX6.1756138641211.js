It’s the kind of thing that takes an army, and his commanders won’t give him one.</p> <p>But Humanity’s position in the great galactic Game is worse off than ever, and they need the resources this colony could provide, so Carter isn’t going to sit idly by. He’ll have to fight an army of zombie aliens, plane sized vultures, and worse. Even alone, if he has to.</p> <p>If he survives it would be an accomplishment, and it's not just the Game threats on the moon standing in his way—the colony Administrator, angry soldiers, and sexy, dangerous aliens all have it out for Carter.</p>";
