Whatevs, haters gotta hate.</p> <p>But when a mushroom cloud of dark and dangerous falls over my family and friends, there is nothing to be done but answer the call and fight. Who's manipulating things behind the scenes? Who's coming after the people I care about?</p> <p>And who the hell is stupid enough to think resurrecting the evil Morgan le Fey is a good idea? Yeah - no, it's not.</p> <p>With evil brewing, enemies running rampant, and The Lakeshore Guild of Empowered Ones ineffective at policing its members, my family and cool new friends set out to right the wrongs of our world.</p> <p>Be the change, am I right?</p>";
