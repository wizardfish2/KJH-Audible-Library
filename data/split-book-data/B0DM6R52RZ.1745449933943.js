He had worked for Legion and his mentor and savior, Felix Campbell.</p> <p>Now, though, Edmund is swapping employers. Moving from the only home he had known and the few people he truly cared for to working for Dorothy after she swaps sides. Which essentially means Edmund will soon be working for a Super Villain, who in turn works for an Evil God. A lot like a global corporation, once again.</p> <p>All of that is mostly irrelevant to Edmund, though. He'll work and do all he can to make sure they succeed. Because all of this is to get a better result than the previous one, which, while it was a good ending, wasn't the best ending. It wasn't a perfect route clear.</p> <p>Now, Edmund is reloading his Save-States to get back into it and test out something he could never actually handle when he played video gamesâ€”the Bad Route.</p> <p>Working for the Evil version of Dorothy and Zeus while attempting to crush everyone else, all while trying to figure out how he can help his little sister.</p> <p>Because Edmund is rather comfortable with his superpower now, as well as the fact that he's now quite aware that he's the only one who can do it.</p> <p>At least, that's what he thought when he started the Bad Route.</p>";
