And then he had to mobilize the planet against the attack of an eons-old ancient menace dedicated to the eradication of all intelligent life in the galaxy! </p> <p>It's hard to blame him for feeling a little stressed, but there's something Colin MacIntyre doesn't know about all the things he's had to do. </p> <p>They were the easy part.</p>";
