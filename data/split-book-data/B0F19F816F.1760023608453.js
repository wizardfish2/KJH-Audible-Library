He's at his lowest point with nothing left to lose. Or so he thought. But when an apparition appears, promising Markus a mysterious inheritance, he's given the opportunity to discover what he's got to gain: a purpose.</p> <p>Transmigrated into a vast wilderness with no signs of civilization, Markus is forced to rediscover who he is while fighting through confusion, fear of the unknown, and the very real threat of death. He had the courage to take the first step, which at least grants a point in his favor but he'll need more than that to succeed. His only objective is to outlive and outlast everything that's coming—for one year. But what's coming for him is absolutely <i>beastly.</i></p> <p>Armed with an extra-dimensional Inventory, a map, animal allies, and a new Tamer Class, Markus is ready for whatever this untamed world has in store for him. Almost . . .</p> <p>Because the ravaging Jurassic predators circling their prey are beyond imagining, and so are the promises of Markus's mysterious benefactor, should he survive. Right now, it's a kill-or-be-killed world. Welcome, traveler. Best of luck.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than a million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
