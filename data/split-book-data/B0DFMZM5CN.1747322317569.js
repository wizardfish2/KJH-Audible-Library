window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Uhh... Is she supposed to have that feral glint in her eyes?</p> <p>Jay Morgan managed to wake his best friend Molly O'Brian from the Portal Sleep that had claimed her. But Molly has changed after her experience in the enchanted dream sleep. Her sweet, bubbly nature is sometimes replaced by a fierce warrior woman Jay hardly recognizes. And this warrior woman has unexpected appetites...</p> <p>It's pretty hot. But Jay's not gonna lie. It's kinda scary, too.</p> <p>In order to help Molly gain control of her her violent and carnal urges, Jay and Lyra--the beautiful and deadly fox-kin archer--must help her become a Delver. Only through integration with the dungeon's magic will Molly be able to overcome her personal demons and harness the potential of the powers she unlocked in the Portal Sleep.</p> <p>Maybe she'll even join Jay and Lyra between the sheets instead of watching from the sidelines, too? [Side-quest Accepted!]</p> <p>But Winterhaven's leader, the wily wolf-kin Runolf, will do anything he can to keep Jay and his party from ever entering the dungeon again. Jay must find allies to help his cause, level up, and get to the bottom of the corruption that has Winterhaven crushed under its thumb.</p> <p>All that, and keep the half-mad dungeon from killing him as it tries to make him stronger. Sure. No problem.</p>";
