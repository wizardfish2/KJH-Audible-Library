Sit. I shall continue....</p> <p><i>Novel contains: strong MC in a slice-of-life environment, dungeon diving, boss battles, cultivation and elements, mana/magic, MC exclusive system (but it doesn't do the work for him), treasures, adventurers, slow world building, build-up, features that will not be introduced all at once (upgrades), actual good loot at the end of very powerful bosses, and romance (no harem). As characters develop throughout the series, issues and emotions and even the MC may find himself in a corner or two.
