His Citadel and his two farms.</p> <p>Before he had only concerned himself with what was near and dear to him, but he'd overlooked that others saw him as a resource to be utilized.</p> <p>Or eliminated.</p> <p>On top of all of that, it’s becoming clear that he’s rapidly reaching the end of his task. A task he doesn’t truly know or understand, but one that he apparently agreed to when he still had all his memories. A task assigned to him by a merciless voice that clearly thinks little of him.</p> <p>Family troubles are starting to look like a sweet memory and dream compared to what’s on the horizon for him.</p> <p>His path could very well lead to the complete collapse of Lamals. At least, if he has anything to say about it.</p> <p>This time around, however, even his axe may not be up to the job and he’ll have to resort to more drastic measures.</p> <p>After all, any problem can be solved with the right application of force.</p> <p>Even a road to hell paved with good intentions.</p> <p>Right?</p> <p><b>Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show. Listen at your own risk.</b></p> <p><b>This story is an Adult Fantasy novel.</b></p>";
