When a job goes bad Quinn must work to keep his family same as dangers mount, even as an ancient magical threat is unleashed.</p> <p>While working to stay alive and to keep the ship flying the Centauri continues to try to find a balance, and truly begins to discover its power with the combined set of talents each brings.</p> <p><b>Warning: This book has explicit sex, nudity, murder, and a lot of crime. There is a harem, a hot alien, a cheerful robot, a kick-ass lawyer, a xeno-archaeologist in a snazzy hat. It's space fantasy and space opera, with a healthy dose of magic, and hard science doesn't apply - and a galactic threat is rising.</b></p>";
