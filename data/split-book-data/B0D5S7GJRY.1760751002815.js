But the outcome was far from anticipated. Instead of mere displacement, he underwent a rebirth.</p> <p>He ended up in a new body, in a new world, surrounded by new threats lurking around every corner. And they primarily manifested themselves in the form of other people. Aristocrats of the ancient empire who fight for supremacy, demons capable of healing the most terrible wounds, and Walkers who have the ability to teleport anywhere they wished.</p> <p>But a true master of alchemy does not allow himself to be perturbed. Edgar's intelligence, skill, and alchemic knowledge are still with him, and the one who has once accomplished the impossible won't go down without a fight, regardless of the circumstances.</p>";
