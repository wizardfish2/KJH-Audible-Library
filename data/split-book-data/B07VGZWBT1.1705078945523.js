window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Wil Wheaton returns to narrate volume two in the Battle for Forever series.</p> <p>Alexander X and his friends have had stadiums collapse on them and ancient teachers follow them; they have driven cars through buildings and had entire streets blown up around them. They've been chased, beaten, drugged, and nearly sliced in two by falling sheets of glass. And that...was just on Saturday.</p> <p>Now, they must do whatever it takes to escape Elam Khai and flee the country. As they search for answers and Alexander's father, they will meet new allies, be confronted by new foes, and uncover more details of the plot that would protect the future for the very few by destroying it for everyone else.</p> <p>Humor, action, and history combine as <i>Ancient Among Us</i> propels us to the moment where everything changes.</p> <p>Nothing about this will be simple or easy.</p>";
