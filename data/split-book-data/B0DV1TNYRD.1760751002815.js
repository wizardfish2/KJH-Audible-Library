But even a knight hardened by war and tempered by cultivation must tread carefully, for the cliffs of Wavecrest conceal more than just crashing waves.</p> <p>Just as Leon starts to find his footing, someone close to him disappears, forcing him into a desperate search through a city rife with deceit and ambition. As he and his companions follow the trail, they uncover power struggles that threaten not just their mission, but their lives. To make matters worse, Leon's enemies are not only numerous but some are far beyond his current abilities, leaving him no choice but to outthink, outmaneuver, and, potentially, endure brutal defeat.</p> <p>Haunted by the toll of past battles and loss, Leon's path as a Cultivator begins to falter under the effects of Qi Deviation—a dangerous imbalance that threatens to unravel both his cultivation and his sanity. With every misstep, the line between friend and foe blurs, and Leon must fight to hold on to who he is—or risk being consumed by the very power he seeks to master.</p> <p><i>Runic Ocean</i> continues the immersive blend of Western fantasy, Chinese cultivation, and LitRPG adventure that defines Will of the Immortals. With enemies both known and unseen, battles fought with more than just weapons, and a relentless storm rising on every front, Leon must evolve—or be swept beneath the tides.</p>";
