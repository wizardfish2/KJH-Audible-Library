window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After a hundred years of regrets, revenge is just around the corner. We have finally reunited with Kristan, Marko, Franja, and Renata, who proved to be instrumental in our battle against Harkel's Hellhounds and the siege on Arrdeam. Having brought down the first leg of Harkel's slaving empire, we're getting ever closer to cutting off the head of the snake. Before we can face him, though, we must still grow stronger, but assassins lurk in the shadows and dangerous foes want us dead.</p> <p>There's only one good thing about the whole mess we keep finding ourselves in: the giant, near indestructible mimic by our side. Chester can turn into anything he absorbs, from a giant carriage to a huge pile of garbage that can even kill monstrous dungeon bosses. And by the end of our quest, maybe he'll have a few more new transformations too.</p>";
