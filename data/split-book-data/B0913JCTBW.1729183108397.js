Keeping the Spider Queen in check and handling water provisions was never what Abby wanted to do with her life, but it’s what the war demands of her.</p> <p>To add to that never-ending list of demands, suddenly Naitee Mungal has need of Abby as well, and unfortunately, Abby already promised she would answer if Naitee called.
