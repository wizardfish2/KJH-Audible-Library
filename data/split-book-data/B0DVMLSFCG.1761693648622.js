That name is still something I’m not quite used to yet. Most of this was an accident. But not a regret. Not even a little.</p> <p>I’d like to say, that boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl and boy marries girl. Unfortunately, or I like to think, fortunately. That girl didn’t know the boy existed, and when I arrived at Dead Man’s Shaft to meet with the lovely Vanessa Weeks for an impromptu spelunking lesson. Well, it was her boyfriend and a few of his buddies waiting for me.</p> <p>Rather than get the whooping of a lifetime, I ran for the darkness of the old mine shaft. Where I took a nasty fall. How it happened, and where I ended up, I have no idea. But the strange, blind, batlike monster hanging from the ceiling when I woke up told me this wasn’t earth any more.</p> <p>The five beings in powered armor that came to my rescue only reinforced that fact. Inside those metal shells, though… Five of the most beautiful women I had ever seen. With eyes and hair like the gemstones they’re named after.</p> <p>This is a hard world. Of struggle, honor, and fantastical technology, unlike anything I have ever seen. Held together by five families, with five elders… Who just so happen to be the fathers of the women who rescued me. And when their attempt to have me executed goes awry with the news of my unknowing betrothal to one of those beautiful women.</p> <p>This world is little like the one I grew up in. Their laws are harsh and absolute. So I better learn quick. Because the consequences can be fatal. And I’m getting rather attached to my rescuers.</p>";
