No one seemed to notice except Ben Cartwright and the other survivors of the hidden plateau in the depths of the Amazon Jungle. Only they were aware of the growing threat to the human race. While Andy lived out his dreams by venturing north to witness the birth of the American continent and navigate a prehistoric inland sea of the Late Cretaceous, whatever he was doing was rippling forward to change our world. Every day brought new threats in the form of creatures that should have long been extinct, or newly-evolved monstrosities that were from mankindâ€™s worst nightmares. The comet, Primordia, was returning and time was up. They had to go back and find Andy and stop him before mankind vanished from the face of the Earth. In the thrilling third instalment of the blockbusting Primordia series, Greig Beck explores a frightening world where evolution has gone wild, while also taking us further into the prehistoric Cretaceous jungle and oceans and to a time mankind was never meant to exist in.";
