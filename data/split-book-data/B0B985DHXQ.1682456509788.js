And this particular [Player] doesn’t like to play by the rules. Being a chaos-loving gremlin, he glitches her out of her programming loop and drags her on various adventures. They'll grapple with friendly sharktopuses, evil emperors, and what it means to be a person.</p> <p>On the way, they pick up equally unlikely party members, with Qube breaking the world in increasingly strange ways as she seeks to be the very best companion ever.</p> <p>All the while, Qube herself slowly realizes that her reality is not quite what it seems....</p> <p><b>Experience the start of a GameLit/LitRPG series about an NPC freed of its programming loop and brought along on a player's journey of adventure and power progression. A loving parody of old-school games, </b><b><i>Dungeons and Dragons</i></b><b>, and every player who has ever thought, “What happens if I do this?”</b></p>";
