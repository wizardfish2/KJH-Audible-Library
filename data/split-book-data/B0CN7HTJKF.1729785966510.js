Its politics are as opaque as the river that flows through it. My enemies are many and hidden, and the identity of my friends is unclear.</p> <p>The Thieves Guild wants things from me, as do the fanatical tribes of the desert, with their allegiances to gods I little understand.</p> <p>And that matters. Because the gods of this world lie behind my challenges.</p> <p>They have plans for me. Plans for me to become something I can barely perceive.</p> <p>Perhaps even to become one of them.</p> <p><i>Warlord of Empyrea is an isekai fantasy adventure in the theme of classic barbarian pulp fiction.</i></p>";
