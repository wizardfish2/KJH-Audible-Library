window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hadjar Darkhan heeded the call of his dragon heart. His path was dangerous, full of hardships and bitter losses. And when he came close to reaching his goal, he lost everything instead....</p> <p>Hadjar survived the bloody war for the throne of his homeland. He fought against monsters and enemies that made entire generations tremble in fear. He traversed the vast Sea of Sand, found the mythical Mage City, and witnessed the destruction of an ancient civilization. Then, in the pursuit of knowledge, Hadjar came to Dahanatan, the capital of the Empire.</p> <p>Hadjar had thought his goal was worth the sacrifice, but now he wasn't so sure. He'd made too many mistakes, lost too much, and paid too high a price by unquestioningly heeding that inexorable call. Had it all been for nothing? What if Hadjar Darkhan was just an ordinary fool who'd found his supposed destiny somewhere it had never been in the first place? No convenient answers were forthcoming....</p>";
