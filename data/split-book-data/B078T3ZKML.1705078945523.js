The world hangs in the balance.</i></p> <p>October, 2042: In two weeks, the world will die, murdered by a nine-mile-wide, extinction-level asteroid.</p> <p>And Robert Osmark - billionaire and savvy tech genius - couldn't be readier for the fiery apocalypse.</p> <p>Unlike the shortsighted masses, he’s been diligently preparing for this day from the moment the asteroid first appeared. Through his relentless efforts, digital salvation now awaits anyone bold enough to take the leap and permanently transition into the brand-new, ultra-immersive, fantasy-based VRMMORPG, Viridian Gate Online. And Robert Osmark will lead this new world he has created.</p> <p>But even with every advantage skewed in his favor, Osmark faces powerful opposition. A rogue faction of global elites led by US Senator Sizemore isn’t content to merely survive the apocalypse. They have their sights set much higher, and are recruiting dangerous allies, undercutting Robert's efforts at every turn, and hiring VGO’s most deadly assassins to get what they want.&nbsp;</p> <p>To win, Osmark will need to viciously crush all opposition before his plans turn to ash.</p>";
