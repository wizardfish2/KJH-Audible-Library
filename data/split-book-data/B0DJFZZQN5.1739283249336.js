window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>5 Volumes for a single credit! Standing butt-naked in long grass and reincarnated in a game land packed full of monsters, what would you do first?</p> <p>A voice fills the sky and announces you as a Lord of that land—how would you feel about that?</p> <p>The same voice tells you ninety-nine other Lords are out for your blood. Would that get your naked ass in gear?</p> <p>Dragon’s Mist is a town building LitRPG adventure fantasy ebook, paperback and audio. The story follows Connor O’Grady as he is thrown in at the deep end to become a Warlord of the Circle Sea, and he'll need a good dose of luck to survive. In this five-book LitRPG series, you’ll have monster battles, full scale war, quests for hidden artifacts, magic, crafting, cultivation progression, humor, and so much more.</p> <p>Connor must form a team with other souls reincarnated from Earth, make alliances with the native elves, mountain men, pixies, and tame dragons and wyverns. You’ll meet Ellen, Sam, Edward, Gilbane, and Dave—whose English leaves a lot to be desired—and they’ll make up his knight’s table.</p> <p>When 100 Lords battle, there can be only one winner!</p> <p>Dragon’s Mist is the first book in the Warlords of the Circle Sea Litrpg fantasy series. Dragon’s Born, Dragon’s Realm, and Dragon’s Knight are all on sale, and the final book, Dragon’s End, will be out this year. Weighing in at over 1.1 million words when complete, WOTCS will remind you of MMORPGs along the lines of Evony, Lords Of Ultima, King of Avalon, where base building is everything and paper castles don’t last long.</p> <p>Dragon’s Mist is a LitRPG Gamelit progression fantasy. It contains curse words, so if they offend you, it’s a pass. The book has in-depth stats, but they are only noted when progression has occurred. There is leveling up, cultivation, magic, rapid build, and a hugely hot war goddess named Xandaphrey.</p> <p>Will Connor O’Grady rise to the top to become the Warlord of the Circle Sea?</p>";
