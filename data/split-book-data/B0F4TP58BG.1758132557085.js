window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Valencion has fallen. The Monarch has been dethroned. Will you slay the five betrayers and restore the realm or escape the ruler’s grasp?</b></p> <p>I don’t know how I ended up in a dark, battle-locked realm, fighting monsters and struggling to survive, but I refused to give up and die. Snatched from death by the mysterious and untrustworthy Monarch, imprisoned ruler and god of the realm, I am ordered to liberate her. To do so, I must prevail against unspeakable horrors and slay the five betrayers to retrieve their golden coins—the keys to her prison.</p> <p>Do that, and I will receive freedom, power, and wealth beyond measure. Too bad I don’t believe in the Monarch’s promises.</p> <p>I cannot trust the rigged deal I’m trapped in, but I have plans to free myself. Thankfully, I won’t have to fight alone. A snow oni banished from the battlefields that defined her life, a half-elf merchant turned fire mage, and a slime knight determined to uphold her chivalry and honor will join my quest. Guided by a blind shrine keeper, the Monarch’s proxy, we aim to slay the betrayers and free ourselves from the ruler’s grasp.</p> <p>When you’re trapped in a crooked game run by a vengeful god, the only things you trust are the women at your side and the weapon in your hand.</p>";
