Should his bond to the book fade, Tal fears he will lose all awareness of the time loop he’s trapped in and any chance of escaping it. He must get Spellbook back before this happens, but the enchantments protecting the pocket dimension are formidable.</p> <p>Another threat is the presence Tal has detected hidden amid the oblivious citizenry of Crossroads—someone else is aware of the loop. A foe who retains their memories is a serious problem, but Tal has no idea who it could be. He’s determined to draw the mysterious individual out of the shadows before they find him first. </p> <p>Tal can’t afford to let his magical and combat training fall by the wayside either. After all, new dangers are revealing themselves every reset—the behavior of the town’s rats are particularly disturbing. So a new instructor is called for, however brutal their methods may be....</p>";
