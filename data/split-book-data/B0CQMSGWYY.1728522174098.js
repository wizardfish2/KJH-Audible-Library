window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Earth is no longer alone, and Van isn't happy about it.</b></p> <p>When the Equal Grasp and other unsavory aliens launch their plot to open humanity up to the stars—in the name of profit, of course—Van and his crew spring into action, fearing the fallout of a world gone mad.</p> <p>With each passing event in his career, Van continues to unravel locked memories, held by Perry, that explain a family history far more violent than he ever imagined.</p> <p>And the memories aren't focused on Van alone. They tell a tale of war in the stars—a war that left the Peacemakers in shambles, the GKU reeling, and three warrior races hiding among the deep.</p> <p>But first, there's the small matter of aliens in Wisconsin... and they're playing games in Van's backyard.</p>";
