A cube whose technology can catapult civilization to dizzying heights - or destroy it entirely.&nbsp;</p> <p>After years of failed attempts to unlock the cube's secrets, all hell suddenly breaks loose. Kelly and a black-ops commando, Justin Boyd, are soon fighting against all odds to stay alive, and to keep the cube out of enemy hands.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the situation quickly goes from bad to worse, Kelly discovers that the cube is far more dangerous than even she had imagined.
