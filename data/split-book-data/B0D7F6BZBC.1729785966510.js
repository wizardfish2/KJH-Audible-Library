window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Tiqr awakes. The dungeon moves!</b></p> <p>Wildlife and monsters have been stirred from their homes by intruders, both in the continent of Chandrar and the Empire of Tiqr, led by Nsiia, the Empress of Beasts, and in Liscor's dungeon, where a certain skeleton continues to help both friend and foes in the only way he knows how. In Liscor, the election will result in a new group of leaders for the city. But is that for the better or worse?</p> <p>The earth shakes with the consequences of unwary actions, both politically and in small ways. However, joy has to be had where you can find it, regardless if you're a skeleton or a Fraerling or [Innkeeper]. Just beware of what's following you from behind. Whether it catches up to you now or later, when the ground moves, nothing will be the same. What survives a Grand Elephant on the warpath, the machinations of the undead, or the Titan's moves? Only time will tell.</p>";
