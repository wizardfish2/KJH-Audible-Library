window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Being a noble is not something Sean ever wanted, but life just propelled him along noble paths. First, he was an Aspirant, then a Knight, and finally, he had become a Lord. In the end, he stopped fighting it, realizing that he would need the social status to keep his promise to Myna and avenge the deaths at Oakwood.</p> <p>Leaving Hearthglen behind, the family moved to the center of Queendom, the city of Accord. As the most important city in the Queendom, Accord had been Shaped from the ground up around the central tree that towered above every other structure in the city. The gigantic tree housed all of the city functions, and was the first project the Queens had undertaken on this world.</p> <p>Sean and his family began to build the allies they could, knowing that Accord would see them dealing with more politics. Hallie set out to make allies with the lesser nobles—with the help of Dame Daria Iceblood—leaving Sean free to focus on his new healing clinic. After all, healing could give him the chance to win more people over.</p> <p>Little did they know that the one they sought to undermine, Lord Truestrike, was already making strides toward his own plans. Soon, Accord would bear witness to two nobles vying to pull each other down…though hopefully without invoking the ire of the Advisor.</p>";
