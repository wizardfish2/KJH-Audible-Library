window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sandra is opposed by a threat thought long-buried in this exciting conclusion to the Dungeon Crafting series....</b></p> <p>After recovering from the effects of a Core shard taking over her mind, Sandra had developed a way to bond with nearby Dungeon Cores, “pacifying” them in the process. Consistent culling of the Monsters within their dungeons would still be required, but no longer would the surrounding areas be dangerous with wandering Monsters sent out by those Cores.</p> <p>Accomplishing all of that will inevitably lead to a greater responsibility that Sandra wouldn’t be able to handle on her own. Fortunately, the surrounding races are more than willing to step up and contribute, thereby slowly taking their lands back from the hostile Dungeon Cores trying to kill them all. With their help, Sandra’s dreams of being able to ignore the world and get back to her peaceful crafting are getting closer to reality.</p> <p>Unbeknownst to the crafty Dungeon Core, however, an old foe learns of Sandra’s existence and is bent on destroying her - one way or another. Only through perseverance, the help of her friends, and quite a bit of crafting will she be able to defeat this adversary; doing so will not only ensure the safety of her Core and the surrounding lands, but it will also establish Sandra’s presence in the wasteland as something meant to stand the test of time.&nbsp;</p> <p>In short, it is time for the craft-loving Core to establish her dynasty.</p> <p>This Dungeon Core story contains LitRPG/GameLit elements such as statistics and leveling and a heavy crafting emphasis. No profanity, sexual content, or harems.</p>";
