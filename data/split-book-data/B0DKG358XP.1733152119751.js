Not only were there few here who possessed strong Gifts, or were truly powerful mages, there were still fewer who knew how to keep their word.</p> <p>How, then, was he to restore the status of the Bulatov Family? Of course, as the head of the Family, Mikhail would never give up, and he always managed to find a way to outsmart his adversaries. But since this world was lacking in specialists who were honest, much less competent, he might as well expand his horizons in his quest for worthy allies. Yes, let's see what another world might offer. How about a specialist in artifacts who is rather antisocial, preferring to study necromancy and the magic of death in peace and quiet, even if he was sometimes the victim of boredom? Why not find reliable companions to secure the comeback of the Bulatovs?</p> <p>Yes, slowly but surely, Mikhail was finding the kind of company he needed, and the castle and lands were growing ever stronger, as was Mikhail himself, although the alien invasions were proliferating, bringing new, even more forbidding adversaries.</p>";
