But hey, I was alive. Reborn in a quaint little town in a magical world.</p> <p>I ended up rooming with a floppy-eared puppy girl and a bubbly hobgoblin who run a bookshop together. Found myself a job, too. Town sheriff! And I’m just in time, because orc gangsters are imposing a reign of fear over the residents, slowly crushing my roommates’ dreams for their bookshop.</p> <p>Oh, did I mention that the same twist of fate that brought me here also gave me superpowers, making me stronger and deadlier than anyone in this world? Taking out the trash is gonna be fun!</p>";
