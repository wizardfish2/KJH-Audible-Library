When the FBI produces a photo proving Rachel is alive and well in Texas, one case is closed but another one is opened. Either this is a case of mistaken identity, or there are more people than just Sloan Jordan and Warren Parish who seem to walk the earth without a soul. </p> <p>Along with Detective Nathan McNamara, Sloan and Warren travel south to find Rachel and solve the biggest mystery of all: determining who - or what - they really are. </p> <p>Just to be clear: the plot of this story is wrapped up by the end of the book. However, a bit of information is revealed at the end so the listener knows another book is coming. </p>";
