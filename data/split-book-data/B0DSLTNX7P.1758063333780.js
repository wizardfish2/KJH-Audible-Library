window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I was the Rift Magus—master of space and time, protector of worlds. For decades, I defended my realm with unmatched power. But when an unspeakable creature threatened everything I held dear, I was forced to create a rift to nowhere—a trap designed to seal it away for all time.</b></p> <p>It worked, but the creature was not without power itself. It warped my magic, twisting the rift I made to take me back home, and I woke instead in the frail body of a young noble, Lucian Alastair Eldraine. Beaten, ransomed, and on the brink of death, Lucian's spark was barely a flicker, his power nothing to speak of.</p> <p>But I am not Lucian. I am the Rift Magus, and though my strength is diminished, my knowledge remains. Now, I must rebuild my power from the ground up, reclaim the magic that was lost, and rise once more before the darkness that haunts me finds its way into this world.</p> <p>I’ve reached the pinnacle of power once before.</p> <p>I can do it again.</p>";
