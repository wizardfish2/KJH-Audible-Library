Rys has an archipelago to conquer, women interested in extending their bloodline with him, and a mysterious labyrinth that holds the secret to why he was sealed away to begin with.</p> <p>But a contract with Hell is eternal. His old employers want to turn him into their pawn, and Rys must become powerful enough to remain free.</p> <p>That’s not a short to-do list.
