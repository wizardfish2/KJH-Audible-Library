But not before he deals with a cultist infestation in his own home.</p> <p>Beset by enemies on all sides, Thorn must choose between keeping himself safe or throwing himself into the jaws of danger to honor the commitments he has made to his friends and allies. When he faces foes he cannot overpower with brute strength, it will take all of his wisdom and fortitude to keep him and his allies alive.</p>";
