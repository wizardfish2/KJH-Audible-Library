To win, Nathan will need to step further along the path of a heretic. He has tamed a pair of demonic Messengers and learned forbidden magic, but his opponents grow in power and number with each victory. While he has the support of his loving Champions, will the world judge him as kindly?</p> <p>All the while, complex schemes simmer elsewhere in the world. A beastkin obsessed with Nathan claims to be a prophet. Foreign nations meddle in the Empire and prepare to invade. And the unfathomable being behind the Messengers weaves chaos into everything.</p> <p>Will victory come at an impossible cost? Or will Nathan finally break the loop of history and craft a new future?</p> <p><i>Heretic Spellblade contains plenty of violence, undefined relationships, beast girls, and scenes that donâ€™t fade to black.</i></p>";
