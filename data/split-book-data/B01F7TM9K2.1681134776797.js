I don't do things halfway. </p> <p>So here I am, alive for some reason, just another sunny day in Miami. It's a perfect paradise, except I'm into something bad. Wanted by police, drenched in the stink of dark magic, nether creatures coming out of the woodwork, and don't get me started on the Haitian voodoo gang. Trust me, it's all fun and games until there's a zombie pit bull on your tail. </p> <p>I'm Cisco Suarez: necromancer, shadow charmer, black magic outlaw, and totally screwed. </p>";
