A people to call his own, a place to belong, and a purpose in his life.</p> <p>He even found love in the form of a spunky wolf beastfolk named Sienna, who had been by his side and supporting him the entire time.</p> <p>Thera was not content with just that as the reward for her champion, the last of a lost bloodline of warriors she had invested her own power into. She sent her own daughter, a demigoddess and primal spirit of the bear, to accompany and protect Koda, as well as join his family if they could connect.</p> <p>With the threat to Silverstone Vale and the Ivory Spear tribe handled within days of Koda’s arrival, he struck out into the world to ensure that there were no more nearby threats, and has pursued one to the nearest town in an effort to secure his people’s lands.</p> <p>Amberpost, the nearest trading partner to Silverstone, is under siege by a force of Crooked. The same Crooked who terrorized Silverstone and Koda cut his teeth fighting. But now they were in numbers that were impractical for Thera’s champion and his allies to fight face to face.</p> <p>First, they need to break the siege, then they need to rally the defenders of Amberpost to clear out their countryside. Only when the threat of the twisted monsters known as the Crooked are wiped from the world can Koda turn his gaze to the other duty and pleasure Thera has promised him.</p> <p>A family.</p>";
