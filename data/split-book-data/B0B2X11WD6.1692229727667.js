window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Game on!</b></p> <p>Aris has come out of cryosleep. She begins her rehabilitation IRL and also begins playing <i>Age of Gods</i>. While she is leveling up to leave the Village of Beginnings, Adam and his party enter the ruins of a magic academy destroyed in ages past. Their goal is to find a hidden class for Fayte.&nbsp;</p> <p>But climbing floor by floor through the ruins of the Magic Academy is a far more arduous task than any of them could have realized. The closer they get to the top, the stronger their enemies become, and what they find after reaching the end may not be a hidden class at all. Will their descent into danger pan out, or will whatever rewards they reap prove useless in the end?</p> <p><b>Explicit content warning: This story contains content that may not be suitable for anyone under the age of 18.</b></p>";
