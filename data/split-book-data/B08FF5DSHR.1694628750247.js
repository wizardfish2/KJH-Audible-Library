window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ryan has died, been reborn as a dungeon core, defeated a necromancer, and made a number of friends along the way. Life, well un-life, is good.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, everything changed when the demons attacked. With his dungeon town in danger and cultists scheming in the shadows, Ryan must decide whether to draw upon the darker side of his own nature - unlocking powers far greater than anything he has accessed before.&nbsp;</p> <p>Something his new dungeon fairy seems suspiciously excited about. With his favorite adventurer, Blake, slowly accepting his new powers as a Specter of Balance, Ryan learns being a darkness dungeon means a lot more than just bones, zombies, and skeletal fight club. Apparently, the power granted by God of Death encompasses much, much more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately, Ryan learns the hard way that some things should remain dead....</p>";
