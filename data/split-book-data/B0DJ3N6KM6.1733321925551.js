window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As a super-powerful warlock living a quiet life in the suburbs of the magical town of Emberfall, I’ve made a pretty good life for myself.</p> <p>Now that the local museum has been turned into a popular tourist hotspot with some of the rarest artifacts around, the reputation of the wood-nymph living in my backyard has been restored to her former glory.</p> <p>With plenty of free time on hand, I can finally start completing a few Handyman Magic jobs around town–once I do that, I can level up enough to get a few really useful spells on my side. When I’ve got those spells, building the luxurious subterranean spa at my house will be a breeze.</p> <p>But there are plenty of distractions around to keep me sidetracked: not only am I growing closer to my beautiful girlfriends, but also Surani herself. With this many women around the house, things are really heating up…</p> <p>And when the seemingly quiet house next door starts behaving strangely, it’s up to me to figure out what’s going on behind closed doors.</p>";
