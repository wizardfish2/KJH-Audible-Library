It has been a long and miserable 13 years, where the best I can manage to do is walk with difficulty. Sometimes, I cannot even manage that.</p> <p>My clan has paid dearly for every minute of my life, and money is not so easy to obtain here at the edge of civilization. Perhaps I might have lived in this state for many years; a cripple, strong in mind but feeble in body. But when some unexpected guests come to our estate, everything changes. I will die at last â€“ or learn to survive on my own.</p>";
