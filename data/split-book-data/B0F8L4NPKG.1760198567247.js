My dream might very well have come true were it not for what I found in the forest. It called to me, woke something buried deep within, a bloodline that raises far more questions than it answers.</p> <p>So, I suppose I'm a bastard with royal blood? To be frank, I'm not sure I give a damn. For now, I'd settle for being left alone with my dog, and maybe save some space for a wife one day. My bloodline's powers are a nice touch though.</p> <p>As with most good things in life, however, it seems my unforeseen inheritance comes with a few strings attached. I struggle not to draw attention as I build up my homestead, blessing the land and my home with my strange gifts. When the captain of the town guard comes sniffing around, I sense trouble is on the horizon.</p> <p>At least I have Pork Chop and the lovely Mira at my side. With their help and the bloodline of kings, I suppose I'll make due after all.</p>";
