A passionate adventure.</b></p> <p>When Jesse, a down-on-his-luck former Marine, inherits a secluded cottage deep in the Oregon woods, he never expects it to come with a mystical secret. Hidden among its relics, he discovers an ancient amulet and a strange compass—one that doesn’t just shimmer with forgotten magic, but transports him to another world: the Ruined Lands.</p> <p>Here, magic breathes through towering forests and lost cities. Jesse’s journey soon entangles him with Liriel, a fierce elven beauty and outcast among her kind, and Inayah, a playful sylph with a tragic past and a sharp tongue. In this untamed realm, alliances are forged in passion as much as in battle, and Jesse quickly finds himself at the center of a growing harem—each woman drawn to him by fate, desire, and the mystery surrounding his arrival.</p> <p>Between selling ancient treasures on Earth and training for the dangers ahead, Jesse prepares to face the brutal ogre warlord, Grunkar Ironhide, whose reign of terror over the town of Woodbreeze threatens everything. With his Marine instincts, modern firepower, and the fierce devotion of his lovers, Jesse must rise—not just as a warrior, but as a leader, protector, and partner in a world that bends to his will as much as his touch.</p> <p>A thrilling fantasy adventure filled with danger, desire, and immersive worldbuilding.</p>";
