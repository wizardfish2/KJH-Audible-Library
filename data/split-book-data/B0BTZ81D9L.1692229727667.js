window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Archon laid low. Power claimed. A new Lord rises.</b></p> <p>Felix has established a Stronghold within the Foglands, now called the Territory of Nagast—just as he is now called Autarch. It is a title he cannot help but claim as Felix sets about securing his new base of operations. Defenses must be managed, benefits enjoyed, and his followers set to explore their new land. Finally, things are looking up.</p> <p>Yet dreams trouble Felix’s sleep. Dreams of fire and sand, wind and undeath. Of crimson armor and golden blades marching across scorched deserts half a Continent away. Among it all, constant and insistent, is need and fear in terrible measure as a figure fights for their very life.</p> <p>A familiar face—another Unbound.</p> <p>And he needs Felix’s help.</p>";
