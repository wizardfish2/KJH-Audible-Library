The day he’d been dreading. The day when he would leave his home and depart for Lightspear Academy, the mysterious school which taught its pupils how to harness magic.</p> <p>While Travis and his friends begin their classes, rumors of dark magic and horrific events taking place across the sea in the kingdom of Luria begin seeping into Valerence. Suddenly, the time for studying is over as a failed ritual rips Travis away from the academy and into Luria. Where he faces horrors beyond belief and is bestowed with a power that will forever change his destiny.</p> <p>The stars are done simply watching events unfold. They have chosen a paladin and made him the first Starwalker.</p>";
