window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Chase is finally coming to understand just what being Prince Chase means, and what becoming emperor of the Solarian Empire will mean as well.</b></p> <p>He's getting better at the job every day. Now if only he could just bring himself to tell Captain Witner and the other members of the command staff that he really is a prince and not the fraud they all believe he is.</p> <p>Another thing he is starting to learn more about is Imperial politics and the kinds of things princes and emperors are known for, as well as expected to do. He's also discovering that there are a lot of people who still believe he's a fraud, because of Neill's efforts at proclaiming him as such. Of course, his criminal background isn't helping him much there.</p> <p>What is helping him however are some of the people he's discovering, and some of the things he's learning about his family from them. There are still a good many surprises in store for Chase. Hopefully, none of those surprises will end up killing him.</p>";
