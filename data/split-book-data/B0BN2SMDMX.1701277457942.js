window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Moving to the Wilds! Jeff's new home is on the brink of destruction. A Spire sunken into the ground, that humanity knows naught of.</b><br> <br> Jeff's original dream of escape, living between cities and the Wilds as a Hunter, has come true. Of course, in that fantasy, he had Alrick by his side and these Hunters are definitely not him. They might actually be closer to his childhood tormentors, Leah, and her Mercenaries.<br> <br> In pursuit of a way to continue to grow the Training Room and himself, conflict festers between his goblin friends Mur and Tet and his fellow humans. Still, is Hunting with his <i>monsters</i> out of the question? Surely his understanding of Dungeons and their strategies means he can at least try…<br> <br> <i>Little does he know that it’s his lack of knowledge that will endanger everyone and lead him to the Spire.</i></p>";
