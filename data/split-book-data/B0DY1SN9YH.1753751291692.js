After having to emancipate himself as a teen and find his own way at a young age, it became part of who he was. The most important part, or so he thought.</p> <p>Until that the faithful day that chance aligned with fate, and his true worth lay revealed when he met with a dying goddess, someone who had lost hope and all but given up until she felt the call from across the void between dimensions.</p> <p>Thera Ivorycrown, known as the Beast Queen, had resigned herself to the deaths of her last few faithful. And with it, the ultimate death of her divinity. But when, by pure chance, Koda wandered within range of the ancient speaking wells of her people, the call of his blood and ancestry spoke to her.</p> <p>The goddess begged him for his aid, as he carries within him the ancient pact of her champions, passed on to him by a distant ancestor of his. An ancestor that Thera had thought lost to the void between dimensions. And Koda answered her call, because she promised him the one thing he sought above all else.</p> <p>A place to belong, a family to call his own, and a purpose to do more than just survive.</p> <p>Join Koda as he enters into a new world, meets with species far different from what he is used to, and finds love amidst the chaos of war that has spanned dozens of centuries. Thera and her people’s survival rests on his shoulders, as he is the last of the lost bloodline, returned once more in his people’s time of need.</p>";
