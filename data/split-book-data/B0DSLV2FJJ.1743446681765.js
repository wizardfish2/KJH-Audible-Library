window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Finishing up his first year as a cadet-adept, Desmond’s life is going pretty well as far as he’s concerned.</p> <p>Three beautiful and exotic women love him and have agreed to entwine their lives together. His powers as an Adept have continued to grow as he practices and refines weaving the threads of mana into the world. All while he continues to defy the expectations set by his origins. Sure, he’s still a member of the active military training for one of the most dangerous jobs in the entire Hegemony, but with his girls at his side, Desmond is confident he can handle it.</p> <p>But things that have been set into motion continue to whir in the background. With a nation as large as the Hegemony of Velvet Stars, occupying nearly two-thirds of the Milky-Way galaxy, there are plots within plots. Plans and schemes that have been moving for longer than Desmond has been alive continue along their planned path, and some of those paths will converge with his.</p> <p>What is a man who’s goal in life is to live up to the image his girls have of him to do? Will they do their duty? Or will they keep their heads down?</p>";
