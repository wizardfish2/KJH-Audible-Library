Again?</i></b></p> <p>Try as he might, Fischer still can't catch a break. Tropica's forces have just perpetrated the fantasyland equivalent of crashing the king's party, kicking over the punch bowl, and making a series of rude gestures on their way out. Unfortunately, they're about to learn firsthand that when you take a bully down to the mat, it's best to make sure they don't get back up.</p> <p>Because their enemies are unearthing long-forgotten powers, and if those dabbling in the resulting destructive chi succeed, they could become even more annoying than the time Corporal Claws hid all of Fischer's pants.</p> <p>Still, as troublesome as existential annihilation might be, the hurdles in one's own mind are a lot worse—and Fischer has more than a little debris that needs to be swept off his mental doorstep. With the help of his friends, it might just be time to take out the trash once and for all.</p> <p><b>The third volume of the laugh-out-loud LitRPG adventure series—a #1 Rising Star on Royal Road with more than three million views—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
