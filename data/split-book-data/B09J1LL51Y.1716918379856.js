Now Alva moves in the background, supporting the Adventurer's Guild. No band of fighters, no sect looking to gain individual honors.</p> <p>The armies of Alva were forged together in Alva dungeon.</p> <p>Tempered in body, in mind, in mana. Supported by Alvan traders, crafters, they reclaimed the lost floors of their home. They captured Vuzgal and defended it in the vicious battlefield realm.</p> <p>Now Alva is going to war. Their abilities, their skills tested head on. One individual is strong. A nation focused, a nation brought together for a single goal. It is something that could shake the very foundations of the ten realms. A beast stirs in the Beast Mountain Range, raising their eyes to the higher realms. It is time Erik and Rugrat stepped out of the shadows.</p>";
