window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Zahn believed that magic existed. He even knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that leftover relics of magic existed in the world. He owned a few, after all. But he always considered himself a rational sort of guy. When he went on \"relic-dives\" to uncover lost magic, he did his research. He didn't believe fanciful myths. He scraped away the garbage and only went after magical items that had a good chance of actually existing.</p> <p>And yet, even though the myths surrounding the powerful Staff of Merlin had always seemed too far-fetched to be true, suddenly a windfall of tempting information fell in his lap. Even worse? There was a deadly mercenary who was trying to find it first. If it was real, and if the psychopathic killer possessed it, then the world could be in serious danger.</p> <p>Along with his new-found lovers, Zahn had no choice but to put aside his doubts and dive into the quest. If they succeeded, they would possess a treasure unlike anything the world had seen in a thousand years. If they failed, magic...even the remnants left over in the relics...might be eradicated from the world forever.</p> <p><b>A Fair Warning!</b></p> <p>This novel contains action, adventure, violence, and copious amounts of intense sex. The sexy fun contains harem elements and intense sexual descriptions that will make the innocent blush for sure.</p> <p>For the entertainment of adults only!</p>";
