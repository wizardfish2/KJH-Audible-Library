All eyes on Drew. </b></p> <p>After teleporting his students all over the world in a rather <i>dramatic</i> attempt to stave off the inevitable apocalypse, Teach is busy. Instead of sipping and relaxing, he now has to slaughter the most powerful of beasts while running around and saving civilization as a whole. Re-Haan, his dragon mistress, isn’t helping either. She just waves him goodbye as he is swallowed by a massive sandworm. </p> <p>When he finds an object that should be impossible, a hyper-dense projectile just like one that nearly bisected and killed him while he was breaking through, Drew sets out, determined to get to the root of this mystery. </p> <p>This fresh start isn’t working out the way he hoped, and all the death threats his students are sending him aren’t helping. Teach might just have to face his past for real in order to survive this one.</p>";
