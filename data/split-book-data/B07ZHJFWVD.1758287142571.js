He is quickly arrested and forced to fight on a secret squad of metahumans who are given a choice between forced military service or prison.</b> </p> <p>The problem is, he has no idea what his ability is, and no one will give him a straight answer. But one thing is clear: he needs to figure it out, and fast, since the success of his first mission hinges on him.</p> <p><b>Prologue</b> </p> <p>I heard her scream again, yelling as loud as she could muster, but it was lost in the fire this time, unable to penetrate the heat. I think she ordered him to stop. We both ignored her anyway, just staring at each other through the white energy pouring out of his body. It was like a powerful storm of pure thermal plasma raging out of him, like shaking hands with the center of a super nova. </p> <p>He wasnâ€™t angry. If anything, he was a little surprised, but there was something else there too. </p> <p>Respect. </p> <p>He was a monster who could survive an ungodly amount of heat, who could live in the flames. And I was equally a monster, who could stand in the flames with him. Something no one else could do. Something he could respect.</p>";
