window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Six months ago I died. And I’ve been looking for my killer ever since. <br> <br> I didn’t expect to survive death, but here I am and I’ve got questions—lots of them. Questions that lead me to a world I never knew existed in the shadows of the mundane. When I come face to face with a vampire who seems to have the answers I’m looking for, I find myself trapped in a game where I’m the pawn. <br> <br> Someone is hunting me. No one is safe until I’m caught, but I refuse to be the prey. When the hunter becomes the hunted, they’ll learn I’m not as naïve as they think. That is, until the mastermind is revealed and nothing is ever the same again. <br> <br> Will I be able to reclaim my old life? Or is the game just getting started?</p>";
