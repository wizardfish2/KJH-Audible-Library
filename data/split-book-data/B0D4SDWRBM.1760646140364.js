I have the ability to reset the entire day, and unlike the weak loops I had before, now I can revert the whole day until I'm satisfied... or the Mana-storm hits Earth.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there's worse waiting for me than an apocalypseâ€”like family. On the plus side, my best friend Sab and I finally meet up, in Paris of all places. We'd both always said we'd go, but I'll admit, I never could've dreamt of the route that led us there.</p> <p>As sweet as our reunion is, we do have to deal with the end of the world.</p> <p>Still... at this point, it's just another Tuesday.</p>";
