At the end of his bloody campaign, he had nothing left. He retired to a humble cottage built from the divine, wood of the World Tree that he chopped down.</p> <p>All was well until, one day, the world shook.</p> <p>The Hero wanted nothing to do with it and went to sleep. The next day, he went outside and saw that his property had been transferred to yet another world.</p> <p>Once more, he had been summoned, but this time, he refused it. He didn’t care. The Hero was done. He was going to live a slow life in his cottage.</p> <p>That’s what he wanted to do, but this new world may have other things in mind, such as a certain loud and proud wolf girl.</p>";
