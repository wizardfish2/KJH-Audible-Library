window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A deadly vampire on the prowl? A beautiful werewolf in heat? A voluptuous dragonkin desperate for a child? This blood knight has his hands full!</p> <p>J.B. Clarke and the lovely ladies of Broken Fang have forged new alliances thanks to their victories against the vampires who secretly rule the world—but their job is far from over! They’re closer than ever to uncovering the secrets buried deep below the city of Chester Creek, and to securing the ultimate weapon in this magical war: the fabled Portal of Gold.</p> <p>But a new threat stirs in the city’s shifter underworld. Whole werewolf packs have shown up dead under ghastly circumstances, and Brooke Hawthorne, a gorgeous wolf girl and one of Clarke’s four wives, begins searching for answers. Together, they start to unravel this new and deadly mystery, but all is not as it seems.</p> <p>Treacherous forces have been playing a shadow game this whole time, and everyone—vampires and slayers alike—are nothing more than pawns to an elusive puppet master. The alluring power of the Portal of Gold has drawn this terrible being to Chester Creek, and Clarke will need all his wits and magic if he’s to survive.</p> <p>His greatest challenge looms just around the corner, but he won’t face it alone: Brooke and the beautiful women of Broken Fang will stand by his side no matter what, and he’s far from defenseless on his own. He’s a blood knight, the last of the great vampire slayers, and he won’t stop until he’s freed humanity from the vampiric scourge.</p> <p>Assuming a creature far worse than any vampire doesn’t kill him first.</p>";
