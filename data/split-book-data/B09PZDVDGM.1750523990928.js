window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An existence spent being forced to kill others to satiate a monster. Where the only thing to look forward to was the blessed, if brief, period of time between paying that bribe.</p> <p>Except that very same monster is and isn’t Rene. It just happened to live inside his own mind and force him to do what it wanted - rather than him being an actual monster. </p> <p>That was Rene’s entire life until a fateful day changed that.</p> <p>A day that his career as a hitman for hire built on the monster’s needs will end. Where Rene will be forced to atone for his actions. To be held accountable and judged.</p> <p>Except the verdict has already long since passed and needs no deliberation. </p> <p>His sentence was being sent hundreds of years into the past, into a different world, even, where he must live a life for the betterment of others. Every action judged as it happens and weighed out against him. </p> <p>But even this new idyllic life he’s been living for 18 years is now completely off the rails, and Rene has gone back into a life lived in the underworld. </p> <p>Armed with a few gifts granted to him by the one who judged him, gifts better suited to a fantasy about living in a video game, Rene has to maneuver his way through all the twists and turns in his new life while using all the things he’d learned in his old one. </p> <p>Except using those skills is a double-edged sword. If he’s not careful, he’ll end up right back where he started. Or so he would hope. </p> <p>War is on the horizon and Felicie is in the crosshairs. </p> <p>Or more accurately, the Mask is.</p>";
