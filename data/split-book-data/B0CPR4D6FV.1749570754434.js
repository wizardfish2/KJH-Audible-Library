window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The world reclaims all things. Humanity thrives within their ever-dying cities. Mages and Archons devote their lives to create the only path forward.</b><br> <br> Tala is finally able to test the edges of her ever growing capacities among a group of peers. Hungry for ascension, she pushes boundaries she once deemed unbreakable, and already Tala has set her sights on advancing further in her power and skills. Yet even as her abilities continue to grow, her first lessons from so long ago still ring true: Magic is expensive.<br> <br> Continuing to Fuse requires a cost that she will struggle to pay. In order to advance, Tala will need to come to terms with every part of herself: where she is, where she's going, and where she came from. Her path will guide her back to those who started her on her journey, and success or failure will depend upon how she confronts her origins.<br> <br> If she ever wishes to become fully Fused, she must find a way to pay the heavy price her magic demands.</p>";
