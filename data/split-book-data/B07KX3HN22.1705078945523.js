Yet they have a mandate, free those that are being oppressed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sarenmenti, Humans, Kuruvians, Chaleelians, and the genetic creations of the AI called the Planner, Avarians, band together under the banner of the Free Fleet to go to the fleetâ€™s birthplace - Earth. Life is nothing but a battle for a survival, and Salchar is going to have to use all of his skills to keep his people alive.&nbsp;</p> <p>The galaxy has a few surprises to throw his way, as well as some politicians up to their own games.
