Gideon Sho -- The Umbral Savage.</p> <p>Excerpt from Book 1</p> <p>A man of wealth and means sits at an ornate table in a high end luxurious hotel speaking into a cell phone, a malicious glint to his eyes as he closes another million dollar pharmaceutical merger. He is blissfully unaware of the man behind him, in a black leather trench coat, a hood obscuring his face in deep shadow, a pistol with a suppressor aimed at the back of his head. Both are frozen within the moment of moments, between a breath and sift of sand, one with the anticipation of a killer, the other, riding high upon the arrogance of wealth.</p> <p>System Initializingâ€¦. -- Romance-- Progression-- LitRPG-- Multi-Versal Factions-- Gods-- GrimDark-- Classes, Levels, Skills, Abilities-- Dragons-- Dragonling Companion-- Horror</p>";
