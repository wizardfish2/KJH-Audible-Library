window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sean had long waited for his chance to avenge his friends from Oakwood— when the time finally came, it was with several unlikely allies: High Lady Minerva Queensblood, who felt her family owed Sean for helping her son, Commander Queensblood. Advisor Mackenzie Earthfoot, who had to walk a thin line to not favor Sean too much, lest she earn the Queens’ ire.</p> <p>With his friends and allies, Sean time and again thwarted Lord Truestrike and his minions. He even befriended his daughter, Dame Trisha Truestrike, giving her hope that she might one day see Darragh again. It was when Sean brought down the Greater Vampire, Luka, that High Lady Queensblood pushed for the duel Sean had long sought.</p> <p>During the duel, Truestrike’s treachery was revealed when he summoned a Life Bonded dragon to kill Sean. Sean almost died a few times, but even a dragon bowed before him at the end. Ironically, it wasn’t Sean who finally killed Lord Truestrike. No, it was Trisha, who slew her father to avenge her lover, Darragh.</p> <p>With Lord Truestrike’s death, Trisha was destined to take over the Truestrike House and have her son returned to her from her father’s grasp. That ended in tragedy, as the spoiled brat struck her down for ‘stealing his birthright.’ His reign only lasted as long as it took the guard to remove his head from his shoulders.</p> <p>But more bad news was waiting— the scribes had sent messages to the Queens. Both Winter and Summer were coming, and Sean wouldn’t be able to avoid them. That put him on the clock to pull off what the stories had said he would do: find the Huntsman.</p> <p>To manage that, he’d need to figure out how to open a portal back to Earth. If he did, Sean would likely find an old enemy waiting for him; Thor hadn’t forgotten the slights against his name, and he wanted revenge.</p> <p>Time was ticking away, and Sean had to work fast. His wives, especially Fiona, were counting on him. Sean had never backed down from a challenge, and he wasn’t about to start now. He’d either figure out how to create a portal, or he’d end up facing the Queens on less than diplomatic terms.</p>";
