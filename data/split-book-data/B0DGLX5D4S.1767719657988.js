window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>New town, new trouble. Scarlett Prynne, her feline familiar Runeclaw, and her beloved motorcycle Dusk Runner tracked the instability in the local magic flows to Moab, Utah. A surge of magic and the earthquake that followed it made clear why they'd been led to this place. Scarlett didn't look for trouble, but it always seemed to seek her out like a hound on the trail of a choice steak. And this day was going to make what she'd dealt with before seem like amateur hour. Is Redthorn Industries, the town's biggest employer at the center of the troubles?</p> <p>Scarlett will need to call on allies both old and new. Jules, the potion-making proprietor of Mystic Brews, is ready to assist. But the real firepower will come from the Witches on Wheels, a group bound together by their magical abilities and love of the open road. And where the Witches are found, the Spell Riders and her friends Maddox and Snow can't be far behind.</p> <p>But it will take even more than that to fight off this menace. Scarlett will need to get back to Oriceran and retrieve her best weapons for the inevitable fight ahead of her. Maybe kick her brother's tail for sending her through a portal onto another planet without her best wand. Trouble at home, trouble in Moab. It's just a regular day for Scarlett, the Nomad Witch.</p>";
