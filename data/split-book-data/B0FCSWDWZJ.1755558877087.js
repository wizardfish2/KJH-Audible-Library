Yes, you still venture into dungeons—two in one day, if you're feeling ambitious—and there are still monsters to fight and treasures to find. But when you come out, what matters isn't the treasures you've gathered, it's whether everyone's coming to temple day or if you can all find something fancy enough to wear to the opera.</p> <p>Sometimes life throws you curveballs, like ex-girlfriends who can bend time showing up at your door. But that's why you need your friends around you—the ones who'll eavesdrop from upstairs windows to make sure you're okay, or teach you about clerical symmetry, or share their family's special fermented seed bars (though you might know them better as chocolate).</p> <p>There's danger out there in the dungeons, sure. But there's also warm houses filled with good company, temple sermons about broken plates, and maybe even a dragon egg about to hatch...</p> <p>Come see what we've built together, won't you?</p>";
