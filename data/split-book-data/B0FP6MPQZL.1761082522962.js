Humanity thrives for the time being, as Mages and Archons devote their lives to give their people that chance.</b><br> <br> With Kit now soulbound, Tala finds her soul pulled further away from humanity, even as her ties to her people grow stronger. Continuing to plumb the depths of her soul, she comes to truly accept her identity as the Ravenous, Jealous Devourer.<br> <br> What is hers will not be taken, and what she gives will yield a greater harvest than ever imagined. What she thought she knew will be tested, and Tala must choose how she will spend her resources, where to invest her immortal life.<br> <br> Yet even immortality does not guarantee eternity, and no human is promised 'forever.' As she navigates the increasing dangers of life on Zeme, she also attracts more attention from those more powerful than she can hope to contest... for now.</p>";
