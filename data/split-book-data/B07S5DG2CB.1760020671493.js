At least that’s his only workable assumption. Given the number of farm-tools left to him. That and the massive number of sacks full of seeds.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this isn’t even the strangest part of this new life.</p> <p>Hidden inside the farm tools, Steve finds messages. Messages that appear in floating windows in front of him.</p> <p>Messages from his past self, telling him that he’d already failed once.</p> <p>But he has no idea what he actually failed at. Or how he can succeed this time.</p> <p>Beyond all this, and unfortunately for Steve, the world just underwent a radical change. A change that’s going to have Steve fighting the undead, bandits, nature, and even himself. All while the world falls down around him.</p> <p>And the only weapon he has is an axe.</p> <p><b>Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show.
