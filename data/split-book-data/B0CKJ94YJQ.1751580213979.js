Even the cops steer clear of the toxic Harban slums.</p> <p>But just across the canal live the magical elite, with their wealth, flying carpets, gorgeous mages, and custom spell beasts, all thanks to the patronage of the almighty Starbrite Corporation. Getting there, and taking his three vulnerable siblings with him, is Truth's only dream.</p> <p>When Truth's performance on the Starbrite Aptitude Test surpasses all expectations, it's the start of a new life. Granted use of the System Astrologica, his access to spells, cultivation tonics, and knowledge—not to mention real food—is limitless. But in Harban, even dreams come with a price tag . . .</p> <p>Turns out, something more than power has been implanted in Truth. Something beyond his control. As the motto goes, \"A Starbrite Man Is Always Ready.\" But for what? Truth is about to find out. Because he's not just fighting to break free from the slums and save himself and his sibs anymore. Now he's fighting the world itself.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit cyberpunk fantasy series—with more than 900,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
