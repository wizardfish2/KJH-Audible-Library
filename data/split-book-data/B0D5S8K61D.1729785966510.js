Planet Earth merges with the magical world of Arcadia, and a system gives humanity a choice: 40 years of indentured servitude, or entering a tutorial as a user to fight against the chaos incursion.</p> <p>Will doesn't hesitate—but the system thanks him for stepping into the fight by throwing him into an impossible tutorial. With little chance of survival, Will has a simple response: “Screw it. Might as well fight fire with fire.\"</p> <p>Warning: [Corruption] has been chosen as primary attribute.</p> <p>With a forbidden element, Will just might be able to stab his way out of the tutorial.

For anyone else, that could mean a quick and terrifying end. To him?</p> <p>Maybe Will was meant for this world.</p> <p>Perfect for fans of Defiance of the Fall, System Universe, and He Who Fights With Monsters—don't miss the start of the hit litRPG apocalypse series with a million views on Royal Road!</p>";
