Living the simple farmer’s life was all he looked forward to.</p> <p>Until it wasn’t.</p> <p>His parents died quickly. Struck down by the wasting sickness. It was all he could do to run and beg the local baron for medicine. Medicine that came too late.</p> <p>Reeling from the loss of his parents, on a farm he couldn’t maintain on his own, Dapy knows he has a debt that can never be repaid to a man who would never forgive it. With a last goodbye to the only home he had ever known, our young farmer stepped off the path... And stumbled over an intoxicated wizard on the road.</p> <p>Through the drunken wizard’s slurred speech, Dapy accepts a job.</p> <p>As a farmer.</p> <p>On a farm, with strange magical qualities.</p> <p>And a history of mysteriously dead farmers.</p> <p>Only now it’s too late. The farm is too important to risk revealing. Dapy is forever stuck. Him, alongside a very cranky cat.</p> <p>Surely the pretty kitty had nothing to do with a range of mysterious deaths? SURELY?</p>";
