With Loki gone, things are finally starting to settle down for the Pale Horseman.</p> <p>At least until a dangerous supernatural virus forces New Orleans to grind to a halt. With thousands of innocent people infected, Lazarus must find the source and shut it down before it becomes a global pandemic. Just when he thinks he's got it under control, refugees from Faerie arrive with dire news. If the creature behind the deadly virus isn't stopped, Earth could be decimated...just as Faerie was.</p> <p>The monster responsible is unlike any Lazarus has faced before, and this is just his opening gambit. But this new foe is about to find out there's nothing more dangerous than a man without a plan.</p>";
