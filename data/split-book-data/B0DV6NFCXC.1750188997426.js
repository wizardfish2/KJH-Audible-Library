window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After Tristan found himself on planet Yaraganin with the rest of humanity, it took weeks to find his way to the spot he would call home. Himself and five other women from the earth and their children made the long trek to Beast Grove. With five other local women and their children, he set up the start of their homestead just in time for the start of a Deep Winter, one that only comes every hundred years.</p> <p>Now the race for survival starts. The fear of starving to death hangs over their heads due to the increased metabolism their higher attributes give them. The northern Iron Dutchy will be plunged into hardship as trade routes are closed by ice, and the population will have to feed on each other to make it through the nearly yearlong winter.</p> <p>Floors in the tower must be climbed, and levels in the dungeon of Beast Grove descended. Credits need to be gained from the system shop as it is humanity's only chance of survival.</p>";
