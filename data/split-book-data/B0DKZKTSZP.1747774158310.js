The Brotherhood of the Lion's Claw has fallen. All of their territory had been absorbed into the Shattered Storm's growing empire.</p> <p>This has not come without a cost. Torin is suffering from a prolonged debuff that endangers his life and he has put his trust in the young Jackson to act on his behalf and further the Shattered Storm's ends in Pandaemonium.</p> <p>Worse, Ashli managed to get a fragment of itself out into the world. The fragment's orders are to rebuild a body fit for a God to rule over the Darkwyrlds with an iron fist. If this was not enough to worry about, Richard Reynolds, the former Governor of Michigan is at large and he has plans of his own that will impact upon Torin and the rest of the world.</p>";
