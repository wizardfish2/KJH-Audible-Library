window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains books one and two of </b><b><i>Legend of Tal</i></b><b>, a sword-and-sorcery, coming-of-age adventure.&nbsp;</b></p> <p><i>A King's Bargain</i>, book one</p> <p>The legend of Tal Harrenfel is sung across the Westreach, and with each telling, the tales grow taller.</p> <p>Though he's declared a hero by his king, Tal has never claimed to be more than a man. After three decades of fighting warlocks, killing mythical beasts, and hunting enchanted treasure, Tal has had enough. Running from the deeds of his past, he retreats to his home village under a different name and meets an unlikely companion: Garin, a village boy who dreams of making a name for himself and seeing the world beyond their sleepy town.</p> <p>When Tal receives a mysterious visitor, both he and Garin find themselves thrown into a sojourn across the kingdom. Soon, they become embroiled in the plots of monarchs, on the frontlines of an ancient war, and at the mercy of a fabled sorcerer. Now Tal must live up to his legend, and Garin must discover his own power, to survive the forces pitted against them.</p> <p><i>A Queen's Command</i>, book two</p> <p>The legend of Tal Harrenfel lives on, and a new song spreads across the Westreach.</p> <p>Though Tal and Garin overcame one enemy, victory promises to be short-lived. Garin struggles with his inner demons. Tal is haunted by enemies and memories alike. And a long-kept secret has torn a rift between them.</p> <p>But circumstances force them to continue their travels together. The roads from Avendor to Gladelyl, once the safest in the Westreach, are rife with danger. And Tal is bound to the commands of the Elf Queen whose intentions are unforeseeable. But reaching the elven realm is only the beginning of their troubles, for Gladelyl is in turmoil. The nobles grasp for power. The underclass and Eastern immigrants seek new rights. And an ancient enemy takes advantage of the chaos to turn them all against each other. Now Garin must come to terms with his demons.</p>";
