As the number one firefighter on the Hot Shot Heroes calendar, he's always had his pick when it came to the dating scene, too. But there comes a time in every man's life where the allure of casual encounters starts to dim.</p> <p>Enter Zuzu, quirky catgirl on the run, bamboozled, sort of, into a contract with Maid For You. She's a whole bag of nerves and cuteness and questionable competency when it comes to maid duties—and now she's Mark's problem. However, something unexpected happens...they get along quite well. More than that, after a few early hiccups, a quick bond of trust and affection forms between them.</p> <p>But it's not all sunshine and roses. Dark figures from Mark and Zuzu's pasts are looking for them both, and the pair of new lovers find out that they have more common enemies than they'd expect.</p>";
