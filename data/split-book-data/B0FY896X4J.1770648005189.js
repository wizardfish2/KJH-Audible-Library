Or maybe we just stopped calling it a war once the Crusade collapsed and the bodies stopped getting counted.</b></p> <p>My name’s James Thorne. I used to be someone, once—Psyker, Apex-ranked, battle-tested. Now I’m just another ghost drifting through the black, looking for somewhere quiet to land.</p> <p>We find Dresen. Dust-choked, half-dead mining town on the edge of nowhere. It looks like peace. Smells like rot.</p> <p>The local militia’s too clean. Their weapons are too new. And the mines? Something down there still breathes. Worse, it’s hungry.</p> <p>Stormfall and I came here to disappear. Instead, we find ourselves knee-deep in secrets, smack in the middle of another mess no one wants to talk about. The drugs, the disappearances, the way the stars don’t look quite right when you’re underground—it’s all connected.</p> <p>I’ve bled for lost causes before. But this one’s different.</p> <p>Because I’m not just a soldier anymore.</p> <p>I’m what’s left when the galaxy turns its back—and I don’t run. Not from the past. Not from the dark.</p> <p>And not from whatever’s waking up beneath Dresen.</p>";
