window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dave Smith is having a bad day, week, month, maybe even year. Freshly unemployed, facing eviction, and now he's been transported to a fantasy world. A wish come true for many a geek, if only he hadn't died less than a day after he arrived.</p> <p>Now trapped in this fantasy realms version of purgatory, he faces the prospect of trying to navigate a new existence as a dungeon. That wouldn't be so bad, except ending dungeons seems to be the path out for many of the other denizens of these Proving Grounds.</p> <p>To make matters worse, the deities of this place have taken a special interest in complicating his stay, for their own as yet unstated reasons.</p> <p>On the upside, he has a new body. </p> <p>Downside, most of the raiders in his region are bearded dudes or ugly and orc like. What's a guy whose life experiences include gaming and working a series of crummy customer service jobs to do. Answer. Work the system, be as obnoxiously obstinate as he can be, and bend every rule like it's made of rubber.</p> <p>Oh, and whine, just a little bit; well, it is all very unfair.</p>";
