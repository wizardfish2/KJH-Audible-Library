Ahten seeks to bring all of humanity under his rule, destroying anyone in his path. But young Prince Gaborn has fulfilled a 2000-year-old prophecy and become the Earth King, a mythic figure who can unleash the forces of the Earth itself. He has managed to drive off Raj Ahten, but Ahten is far from defeated.</p> <p>Striking at far-flung cities and fortresses, Ahten seeks to draw out the Earth King from his seat of power and to crush him.
