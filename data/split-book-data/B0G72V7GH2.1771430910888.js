What he really got was a flying rust bucket and a cosmic mess with his name all over it…</b><br> <br> Weeks after his beloved father’s passing, Jace Jones is surprised to discover he’s been left a ranch in the middle of nowhere; a place so remote, even the tumbleweeds are lonely. Curious and confused, he makes the trip... only to watch a starship drop out of the sky and obliterate the entire property!<br> <br> Inside the smoking wreck? No crew, and no answers. Just a sarcastic onboard AI, a storage bay stuffed with useless contraband, and a mysterious set of coordinates burned into the flight computer. And if all that wasn’t puzzling enough, the ship greets Jace like he’s its long-lost captain…<br> <br> Now, dizzily launched into a deep space adventure alongside his sass-bot copilot, sustained by critical circuitry held together with tape, and troubled by the prospect of a shadowy alien stowaway, Jace must unravel a galactic mystery tied to a past he never knew he had.</p> <p><b>Turns out, some legacies aren’t handed down in wills…<br> They come screaming out of the sky, loaded with secrets, sarcasm, and space grease.</b></p>";
