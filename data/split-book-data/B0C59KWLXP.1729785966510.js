window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>***A LitRPG Progression Fantasy Epic***</p> <p>Beneath the light of three moons, the world of Aster Fall lies shattered. Classes are broken, Outsiders are invading, and the future is unknown. The ancient guardians have left and no one knows where they have gone. The fate of the world lies with one young man. Sam Hastern.</p> <p>His family has been cursed by a broken class for the last fifty years. No one has ever managed to level it, condemning them to the lowest paying jobs and life in a barren village. It is called Battlefield Reclaimer. The only information he has is the class description that it is an ancient enchanter and smith, along with a quest to seek out a battlefield and learn how to reclaim the artifacts of the past.</p> <p>There's one more little problem. Sam's about to have it even worse when a dungeon exploration leaves him looking distinctly non-human.</p> <p>All he wants is to protect his family and study magic, but to do that, he'll learn ancient magic and walk in the footsteps of the old rulers of the galaxy.</p> <p>A Titan is rising, and the Primal Void is coming with him.</p> <p>*In this work, you'll find leveling, crafting, experience-based progression, rare classes, class evolutions, and strange races. The world runs on mana crystals, beast cores, spirit veins, alchemical pills, and enchantments. The environment is hostile and filled with monsters and elemental storms.</p>";
