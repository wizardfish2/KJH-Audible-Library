It’s all about to end in one climactic crescendo. </p> <p>The story continues with Captain Jason Reynolds and his team: Billy, Rizzo, and the rhino-warrior, Traveler. They must attempt to rescue Ricket and Gaddy, still held captive aboard the impregnable Dreathlor prison barge. Only then can Jason return to <i>The Lilly</i>, his highly advanced Caldurian vessel where it all began. </p> <p>The elusive Admiral Ot-Mul, leader of the Craing Drac-Vin forces, has not only survived, but thrived, in the far, outer-reaches of space. With hundreds of thousands of warships under his command, Ot-Mul’s combined fleets are on the move. But in truth, he cares about little else than making one man suffer…Captain Jason Reynolds. </p> <p>With the approach of an enormous fighting force on the horizon, it’s the last call to battle. Will the decimated Allied worlds reunite one more time? Will Ot-Mul get his vengeance by taking those dearest to Jason—Mollie, Boomer, Nan, and Dira—and use them to rip Jason’s world, his very existence, apart?</p>";
