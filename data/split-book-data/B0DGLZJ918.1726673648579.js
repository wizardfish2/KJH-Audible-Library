And Jonathan is about to go there…</p> <p>The world of Skyhall awaits, unlocked by a mysterious inheritance from Jonathan’s eccentric, adventuring uncle. The threats are legion—dungeons, undead, wyverns, and beastfolk—but Jonathan has a unique class that will give him the power to expand and improve his own airship. In time, he will turn it into a veritable fortress and flying palace.</p> <p>Also, he won’t be going to Skyhall alone. His high school crush, Mackenzie—who has had a serious glow-up—will be joining him. And who knows who else Jonathan will meet on his journeys to complete his adventuring party?</p>";
