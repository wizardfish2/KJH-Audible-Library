window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The complete trilogy!</i></p> <p><b>Siege the castle? Not my style. Save the world? Never going to happen. Create a bestiary business with a group of beautiful yet contrasting women? Now that’s more like it!</b></p> <p>One minute I’m in a tree, pointing my camera at a tiger, the next I’m on my back in a medieval fantasy world, while a skittish blonde hovers over me, hoping I’m not dead.</p> <p>I’ve never felt more alive.</p> <p>Because although the dutiful smith’s assistant warns me away from the town’s sinful witch, I still have to go. The witch has the only bestiary book in town, and that’s my one hope of a comfortable life—I don’t feel like donning knight's armor.</p> <p>Turns out, the bestiary is terrible—it's just primitive drawings, annotated by the tall tales of drunken adventurers. I know an opportunity when I see one. It’s a good thing I’ve been transported here with my camera.</p> <p>If only I knew someone with magic powers, able to transfer film to parchment. Someone like the witch, currently scowling at me. How will she look when I turn her house into a walk-in bestiary?</p> <p>And how about a scribe to pen beautiful prose beside the photos? The shy smith’s assistant wrote some incredible weaponry advertisements. I can find a few better uses for her.</p> <p>It’s a shame the girls dislike each other. I’m gonna have to show them they’re more similar than they know. For starters, they’ve both taken a liking to me, and I don’t feel like choosing.</p> <p><b>This audiobook involves:</b></p> <ul> <li>A shy smith’s assistant with adorable blonde pigtails who’s going to learn to speak up for herself</li> <li>A snarky witch in a black dress who’s going to learn to keep her mouth shut</li> <li>A vicious goblin who's going to...you’ll just have to wait and see</li> <li>A wild jester, unpredictably enticing</li> <li>And a few more...but those would be spoilers</li> </ul>";
