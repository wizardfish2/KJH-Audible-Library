I have plans, and inheriting a magic shop in a sleepy, mysterious little town isn't one of them.</p> <p>But when I discover a stunning girl named Elodie, with cat ears atop her head, working at the shop, I can't help but be intrigued.</p> <p>At first glance, I assume Elodie is just another pretty face working at my grandfather's magic shop. With her sleek hair, mesmerizing green eyes, and curves in all the right places, it's hard not to be distracted by her stunning appearance. But as I soon discover, there's much more to Elodie than meets the eye.</p> <p>Despite her alluring appearance, I assume Elodie is just another employee until I learn that she's actually a familiar, a magical creature bound to the shop and its owner. With Elodie's help, I discover that I have undiscovered magic powers, which I must master to save the people I love from the clutches of the enemy.</p> <p>As if that weren't enough, I find myself face-to-face with a waifish, beautiful girl who wants to help even though she's supposed to be on the enemy side and a mysterious genie who wants to grant me my wishes. With the girls by my side, I navigate this new and dangerous world of magic, battling dark forces and uncovering the truth about my own heritage.</p> <p>Will these beautiful, strange girls be able to help me unlock the secrets of the magic shop and save the little store—and my legacy—from certain doom, or will we fall prey to the forces of darkness that seek to destroy us?</p>";
