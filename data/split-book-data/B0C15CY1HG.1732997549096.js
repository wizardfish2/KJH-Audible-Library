She’s simple like that—but her life is about to drastically change. Although Liv would rather stay out of the politics and conspiracies that she ran away from years ago, her family needs her. It’s only a twelve-year stint until her sister, the next in line, can take over. So what’s the harm in activating her magic and accepting her place as a warrior?</p> <p>Book Two, The Uncooperative Warrior: The House of Seven keeps sending Liv on wild goose chases, but this warrior has a way of stumbling upon clues.
