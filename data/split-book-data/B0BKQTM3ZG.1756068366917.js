Breene will take you on a magical joy ride you won’t soon forget.</p> <p>Supernatural Bounty Hunter isn’t the sort of thing you see on LinkedIn. But with a rare type of magic like mine, I don’t have many options.</p> <p>So dangerous or not, the job is mine. And it was going fine, until an old as sin vampire stole my mark, and with it, my pay day.</p> <p>Knowing I’m poor and desperate, he has offered me a job. I’ll have to work by his side to help solve a top secret case.</p> <p>Everyone knows not to trust vampires. Especially a hot elder vampire. But without any other jobs coming up, I’m stuck. As I uncover a web of lies and treachery, revealing an enemy I didn’t know existed, the truth of my identity is threatened. I might make it out alive, only to end up in a gilded cage.</p> <p>Performed by Alyssa Keegan, Gabriel Michael, Nanette Savard, Terence Aselford, Holly Adams, Julienne Irons, Ken Jackson, James Lewis, Elliot Dash, Joe Mallon, Ian Putnam, Tyler Hyrchuk, Nick DePinto, Michael John Casey, Yasmin Tuazon, James J.
