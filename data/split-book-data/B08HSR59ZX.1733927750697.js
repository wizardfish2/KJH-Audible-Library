So, when the powers-that-be decide citizens will be able to live in a virtual reality fantasy world, it seems like the perfect solution for an angsty teen. No more teachers, no more books, no more parents' dirty looks.</p> <p>Nothing's ever that easy though, and trying to game the system leaves Nathan stuck halfway between player and NPC, able to see mana and direct its flow, but unable to cast any spells of his own. On top of that, the five kingdoms of The Boundless are ready for an all-out war. All they've needed was a ready supply of immortal warriors....</p>";
