She'd say it's because trouble is attracted to her. Either way, danger is on their tail. A stop at a ghost town ends with the ghosts trying to kill Scarlett, and okay, worse, trying to damage her enchanted motorcycle, Dusk Runner. Provo, Utah isn't much better. Magicals aren't exactly welcome in the town. Scarlett catches word that Redthorn Industries wants it that way.</p> <p>Scarlett and Redthorn have a bad history. Round two isn't going to be any better. On her side, Scarlett has new allies in Provo's magical community looking out for her kind. The magical kind. And her old allies, the Spell Riders and the Witches on Wheels, who are always looking to roll into trouble and mix it up. She'll need them all. Redthorn is up to something big, and Darrin Redthorn, the CEO, has a personal grudge against Scarlett. Blowing up their operation at the previous stop on her trek across America's western states didn't make him happy, to say the least, and now he wants to return the favor.</p> <p>Scarlett Prynne is right in the middle of chaos again. As if that wasn't enough, college students are vanishing from the local university, and no one knows why. As Runeclaw would say, it's the duty of a guardian to check it out.</p>";
