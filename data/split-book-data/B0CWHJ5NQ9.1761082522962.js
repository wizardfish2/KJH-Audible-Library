Thankfully, the System granted me the power to bring forth monsters from the void. With this ability to command magical beasts, I might just live out the apocalypse.<br> <br> Together with a ragtag group of survivors, we're wading through the mayhem while searching for somewhere safe. Somewhere that monsters aren't desperately trying to kill us, where the opportunistic among humanity aren't looking for easy XP.<br> <br> And what better place than Merlin Ranch, my childhood home. It's where I was raised, and I know for a fact that it'd make the perfect refuge.<br> <br> Somehow, we'll make it to the ranch. And when we do, we might just untangle the mystery of the System.</p>";
