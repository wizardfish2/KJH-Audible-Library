She fancies herself something of a saber-toothed tiger, and claims to have wrestled the thread of her ninth life from the hands of the Fates themselves\\â€”although, I'm pretty sure that last part isn't true.</p> <p>Almost positive.</p> <p>I'm still looking into the magical fine print, but in the meantime I'm stuck as the guardian to an snarky immortal cat with a nonexistent filter. Oh, and by another cruel twist of fate, my ex-husband just moved back into town.
