He just didn’t expect a god-like AI to transform it into a damn video game.</p> <p>Now he has to pick a ‘class’, survive a ‘tutorial’ (filled with monstrous creatures trying to murder him), and somehow find his brother Blake before the idiot gets himself killed.</p> <p>OK. Blake’s no idiot. He’s a charming, incredibly lucky, ambitious world-beater. But he was destined for corporate boardrooms, not monster filled forests, and Mason knows he needs to reach him before it’s too late.</p> <p>But as he claws his way through this dangerous new world, gaining superhuman abilities and meeting a beautiful woman who desperately needs his help, he begins to realize: it just might be the best thing that’s ever happened to him.</p>";
