Without his own name, without the future he always yearned for, things seem bleak for the young Summoner.</p> <p>Or, at least, they would...if he didn't have her. Samuel and Aurora retreat into anonymity, posing as a young married couple working for a rural wing of the Mysterium. For now, their lives are a romantic pastoral fantasy brought to life, but both of them know that won't last for long.</p> <p>The drums of war beat louder and closer to home, and the increasing monster attacks threaten even the new railways connecting the cities of Terth. These are problems that Samuel and Aurora will have to face...ready or not.</p>";
