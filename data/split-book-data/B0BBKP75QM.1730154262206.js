window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In a world full of super powers, Felix had a pretty crappy one.</b></p> <p>He has the ability to modify any item he owns; to upgrade anything. Sounds great on paper. Almost like a video game. Except that the amount of power it takes to actually change, modify, or upgrade anything worthwhile is beyond his abilities.</p> <p>At least, that was until Felix leveraged a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give himself a great deal of points. Investing in Super Heroes and Super Villains and owning them. Using them, Felix built up an empire: an organization by the name of Legion.</p> <p>It grew to heights that could stand toe-to-toe with governments, even at a military level. Surprisingly, not a whole lot changed despite becoming a mega-company CEO.</p> <p>Politicians were still corrupt. Banks still held onto your money. And criminals still committed crime. Governments still wanted to take everything from Felix and Legion. In the end, Legion had to back down. Retreat back to a new homeworld, losing important people in the process.</p> <p>Kit Carrington and Lillian Lux sacrificed themselves to save him and were marooned on a hostile planet. Even as their home world fell into ruin, Felix fell back. He resolved himself to wait for a chance to get back into the fight after tending to his wounded organization.</p> <p>Now, the Overgod Runner has just appeared and offered him a second chance to rebuild Legion and crush everyone in his way. If he could do that, and take over the government of the country he’s about to be dropped into, he’ll get Kit and Lily back.</p> <p>There was no way Felix would let go of this chance, nor could he even consider the possibility of failure.</p> <p>It’s time to get Kit and Lily back. Legion First.</p>";
