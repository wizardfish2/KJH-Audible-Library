The answers she receives from Levi are something that Reece would never have imagined possible. There is life beyond Earth, and it exists because of her! </p> <p>As she struggles to cope with this theory, she is forced into a futuristic car where she meets another strangely familiar man who introduces himself as Harrison and informs her that he and Levi are from a dimension known as Pemdas. Traveling at what appears to be light speed, Harrison continues to inform Reece that he and Levi are her personal guardians who are sworn to protect her at any cost. </p> <p>Impossible!

Her answers come swiftly when the car they are in transports them into an entirely different environment. She is rendered speechless as she studies the vivid nature that surrounds them. </p> <p>Transported into a magical land?

With this, she discovers sweeping landscapes and capricious creatures who transfer their energy to the people of Pemdas. Most of all, she experiences peace in her life like nothing she has ever experienced. </p> <p>Her newfound peace is instantly replaced with the shock of her life when she is placed in danger! Betrayed, the Guardians now must defeat their greatest enemy as all dimensions turn against them.
