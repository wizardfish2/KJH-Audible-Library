window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Have you ever wanted to learn a craft? Then why not consider artificery-the art of adding magical effects to everyday things? You'll make never-ending beer mugs, clocks that tell not just the time but the future, and even bathtubs that keep the water a perfect temperature forever. Who wouldn't want that?</p> <p>You'll get to live in the sunlit village of Sunhampton, a friendly little town of cobbled streets, cozy cafes, and a marketplace home to the most wondrous products you could imagine.</p> <p>If this sounds like just the thing for you, then grab a mug of hot chocolate and a honey twist, and follow Lewis as he drives himself to becoming the best artificer in the land.</p> <p>Lewis is no longer a mere apprentice. Through hard work, failures, and triumphs, he has risen in the artificery ranks, but his journey is only just beginning. When a familiar face returns from his past and asks him to create a mysterious item, he knows his talents are going to be stretched thin.</p> <p>It'll be hard work. But with mentors to guide him, friends to help him, and his own never-say-die attitude to keep him going, he knows he'll get there.</p> <p>Why not get yourself over to the cozy town of Sunhampton and join him on his quest?</p>";
