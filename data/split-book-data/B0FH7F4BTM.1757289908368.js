Too bad not everyone agrees.</b></p> <p>After years as the Free States of Caldia's most lethal weapon, all I want is to study magic at Stoneway Academy and find something resembling a normal civilian life. The Great War against the Democratic Republic of Auropa has finally come to a ceasefire, but tensions haven't necessarily died down overnight.</p> <p>When I finally started courting witches as a bright-eyed student, I was hoping I'd find romance. Instead, everyone is reminding me of my civic duty as a warlock to procreate for the betterment of Caldia's future. Somehow I ended up with a vampire-obsessed roommate who's convinced I'm undead, two beautiful witches pretending to be my girlfriends, and a tiny demonic familiar with the least wholesome idea of world domination anyone has ever heard of.</p> <p>But the heavily slanted witch-to-warlock ratio and all its implications are far from the most stressful part of my new life. In fact, I've discovered a conspiracy beneath the school—something designed to shatter the fragile peace between nations. Just who is behind this scheme, and how deep does it go?</p> <p>Now I'm the only one who can stop it—me and the women who adore me, that is. With my blood magic and the help of academy witches getting their first taste of real combat, I'll have to embrace the very violence I came here to leave behind. But that won't stop me from enjoying our downtime together.</p> <p>One way or another, I will protect the peace, and the women, I've sacrificed so much for.</p>";
