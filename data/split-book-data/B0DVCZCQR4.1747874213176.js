window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The complete series in a single offering!</b></p> <p>Accountant by day, King of the Goblins by... accident?</p> <p>Ethan's got a cushy job and an empty apartment to prove he's mastered monotony. But a mysterious talisman sends him tumbling into a whole new world—quite literally. He says goodbye to spreadsheets and hello to becoming the first-ever human Goblin King.</p> <p>Rivals? The ex-King’s ticked-off offspring are itching to overthrow him.</p> <p>Duels? They’re on his calendar next to ‘avoid rebellion.’</p> <p>Wives? He’s required to have at least two.</p> <p>For a start, he chooses a curvaceous shaman with a presence as magnetic as her powers and a warrior whose scars tell a thousand tales and her audacious battle-cries are as compelling as her, um, assets.</p> <p>As Ethan juggles fiery flings and political uprisings, one thing's for sure: being king is anything but boring. Will Ethan tame his rebellious kingdom and win the hearts of his wives, or will he be dethroned in love and war? Dive in for an adventure that's equal parts steam and steel.</p>";
