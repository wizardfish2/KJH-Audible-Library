window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The season of peace has ended, the dawn of war has come, and even the gods are restless...</p> <p>Brian Fieldings just buried his dad and lost the only job he's ever had. Waking up in an unfamiliar, pitch-black room the next morning feels a lot like the rotten cherry on a particularly awful sundae. Especially given the inhuman howling coming from the other side of the door.</p> <p>He's only been conscious for a minute or so, but Brian already has questions. Where is he and how did he get here? What is making those terrible noises? And why does the room he's in have an altar?</p> <p>First, he’ll need to survive long enough to get answers… then he’ll have to survive those answers. Because Brian has been tapped to play a role in a bloody drama that spans multiple realities, and nothing from his short life in Midton, Ohio has prepared him for what's next.</p> <p>Speaker of Tongues is the first book in a slow-burn progression fantasy where the numbers and stats typical of LitRPG books are grounded in an epic fantasy world and balanced by a focus on party-based adventuring, group dynamics, and themes of personal growth.</p>";
