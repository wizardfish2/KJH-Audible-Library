window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains books 1-4 of the Towers of Acalia series.</b></p> <p><b><i>The Reincarnated Core Volume 1</i></b></p> <p>My name's Rin, and I've been reborn as a cultivator with a broken core. Time to save the world.</p> <p>Thankfully, the spirit who reincarnated me modified my core with a rune of power. Now, each time I ascend to a higher level, I can add a new rune, enhancing my strength. But this gift was given with a condition: if I don't climb and conquer the Towers of Acalia, this new world will fall into ruin.</p> <p>Plenty of obstacles stand in my way: raging spirit beasts, tower-summoned monsters, rival cultivators. But by bonding myself to gorgeous women warriors, I can ascend and grow strong enough to take on the seven towers. Gods help anyone who stands in my way.</p> <p><b><i>The Reincarnated Core Volume 2</i></b></p> <p>With my core enhanced by runes of power, I'm progressing faster than any cultivator in Acalia.</p> <p>Headed to defeat the Forest Tower, Astra, Brea, Minh, and I are ready for whatever this strange world can throw at us. Unfortunately, not all is right in Acalia. With another tower to climb, monsters to kill, and rival cultivators testing me, I'm going to have my hands full. Unforeseen allies and a gorgeous new companion are exactly what we need to make the climb.</p> <p>May the Towers watch over us all.</p> <p><b><i>The Reincarnated Core Volume 3</i></b></p> <p>As my core continues to grow in power, so do the challenges of Acalia's fearsome towers.</p> <p>After crushing the Forest Tower and moving into a home big enough for my four companions and me, a period of relaxation feels much deserved. Fate has other plans for us, though.</p> <p>When troubling news arrives from the South, we pack up our things and ride for adventure once again. Minh, Astra, Siobhan, and Brea ride beside me as we head deep into the riverlands of Southern Acalia. At the end of every coursing river, the Lake Tower waits, tall and imposing.</p> <p>The Third Tower isn't as straightforward as it once was. Everyone keeps saying the same thing: The towers are harder than they've ever been, and the monsters that lurk there are far too powerful. With the strength of my enhanced core and the courage of allies, I know we will be up to the task.</p> <p>My only worry is... can we do it in time?</p> <p><b><i>The Reincarnated Core Volume 4</i></b></p> <p>Towers to crush and a Fallen God to slayâ€”what a time to be a cultivator.</p> <p>After killing a fabled beast at the Sky Tower, my vessels and I must return to the Grandmaster of Pine Mountain. There, we'll be pushed to the limit so we can unlock our fullest potential.</p> <p>With Tig's knowledge of Acalia's lore and the guidance of the Grandmaster, our party will go on a quest of unparalleled difficulty.</p> <p>The Sky Tower must fall, and the shadow that lives in its upper chambers along with it. Such a task will require every ounce of courage we can muster, as well as the assistance of old allies.</p> <p>Our mission leads down a dark and daunting path... May the Seven watch over us.</p> <p><i>This series includes elements of LitRPG, isekai, cultivation, and a slow-burn harem. Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
