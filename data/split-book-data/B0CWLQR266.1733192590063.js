window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jack Pritcher has hit rock bottom, losing his home and job. Just when he believes his sanity might be next, he's presented with an opportunity that sounds utterly unbelievable.</p> <p>The offer on the table is to become a guardian of a Portal, a doorway to another world. But there's a twist â€“ he must keep it a secret. Portals, it turns out, are alive in some way. They possess sentience and dictate their own set of rules that guardians must follow, under the penalty of death.</p> <p>As Jack delves deeper into this enigmatic role, he uncovers remarkable benefits that he's not willing to jeopardize by disregarding the rules. Along this extraordinary journey, he learns that his old landlord, the elusive Mr. Peebody, had been a guardian for years, amassing his wealth through the Portals. Now, Jack inherits that legacy, with the excitement of boundless opportunities. The only catch? Survival, because the world on the other side of the Portal is a far cry from Earth's safety.</p>";
