window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Kevin Pariseau elevates this near-future sci-fi tale with a pulse-pounding delivery, narrating the science, the suspense and the horror of this all-too plausible tale from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Douglas E. Richards.&nbsp;</p> <p>When a small alien spacecraft lands in the Amazon jungle, the world's most powerful nations race to retrieve it and harvest its superior technology. The dense rain forest renders traditional military vehicles useless, so the United States sends in a single operative - a powerfully enhanced human sporting revolutionary technology. But the interstellar visitor has arrived with a secret and gory purpose of its own. <i>Seeker </i>will have listeners running for cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
