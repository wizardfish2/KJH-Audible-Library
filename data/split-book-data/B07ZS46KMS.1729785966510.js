window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ryker only had one goal in his life right now: turn a certain adventuring guild into a flaming wreck while dancing merrily through the smoldering ruins. All for the chance to get back at a handful of people.</p> <p>It didn’t work out that way though.</p> <p>At all.</p> <p>He’d died, been forced into the body of an avatar, absconded with the queen as her castle fell to betrayal, kidnapped a little kid who is obviously more than he seems, and to top all that off, he killed his undead father.</p> <p>The smoldering ruins of the queendom have cooled, the patterns reset, and Ryker has a task that is more than likely too much for him.</p> <p>Take the queendom back, destroy two armies, and give Lauren, the rightful queen, back her crown.</p> <p>Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show.
