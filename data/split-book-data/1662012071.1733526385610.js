Never before has a female been chosen to ride a dragon.</p> <p>The Elite, a guild comprised exclusively of dragonriders, is dead according to most. No one has seen a rider in decades. The problems they used to fight overwhelm the world. Dragons are thought to be near extinction.</p> <p>However, the Elite aren’t dead...It’s just that a bunch of crusty old men who do nothing that benefits the world at large are easy to mistake as useless corpses.</p> <p>Sophia Beaufont is about to change all of that.</p> <p>When the dragon egg that magnetized to her hatches, it sets Sophia on a new course. The Elite are immediately notified. She’s expected to train, defend, and fight.</p> <p>Sophia is ready to conquer evil, as the dragon riders should have been doing for centuries. However, the Elite have been turning a blind eye, allowing the world to be overrun by criminals.</p> <p>That’s all about to change. S. Beaufont isn’t a girl who will be told to sit down and relax when a war is brewing that only a dragonrider can extinguish.</p>";
