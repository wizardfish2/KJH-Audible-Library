window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A realm at war. The star dragons struggle under the oppression of an unseen foe—a creature of terrible power, who seeks to shape all of space-time into a web of subjugation and death. The Dream Mountain, source of knowledge and life to the dragons, is held by the enemy; and yet, hope burns in the dragons’ hearts. According to ancient prophecy, One will come from outside to challenge the darkness. Star pilot Jael LeBrae may be that savior. Once before, she aided the dragons in their struggle, and now she must return to face at last the terrible wrath of Tar-skel. But if the prophecy holds true, the price of victory over the darkness will be Jael's own life. </p> <p>Captivating sequel to <i>Dragons in the Stars, Dragon Rigger</i> is science fiction with mythic dimension, from the Nebula-nominated author of <i>Eternity's End</i> and <i>The Chaos Chronicles</i>. </p>";
