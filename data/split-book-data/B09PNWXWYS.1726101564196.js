February is filled with opportunities for growth.</b></p> <p>A lord according to the system, Grant Monday has arrived in February. This place is the absolute opposite of January, and his largest challenge isnâ€™t hostile Wielders. Instead, the new lord needs to face culture shock, contending with strange foods, stringent training, and a stomach-churning subrace of humans known as \"Joggers\".</p> <p>Grant chose the wrong time to try to take on the world: Every single citizen of February is a powerful body cultivator, and this year there has been a huge shift in the power dynamics of the District. Not only is everyone fervently training, they all have the same end goal as Grant. Only the finalists of the Body-focused tournament get the chance to go head-to-head with Lady February, and Grant is a decade behind.</p> <p>People are doing anything they can to get an edge. Grant is happy to introduce them to his blade.</p>";
