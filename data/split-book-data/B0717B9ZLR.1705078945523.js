window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Dr. DOA</i> comes the next Secret Histories adventure. </p> <p>It's never pleasant being poisoned. It's even worse when you're marooned in another world with no access to an antidote. Since Dr. DOA has trapped Eddie and Molly in Other Drood Hall, they need to escape, and fast before the dastardly doc can murder anyone else. But first they'll have to fight off the MI 13, a military organization that has plenty of tanks and lots of heavily armed soldiers. </p> <p>With the help of a fellow prisoner of the extraterrestrial variety, Eddie and Molly make their way home, only to find that things are more dangerous than when they left. Eddie will do anything to find the terrible secret that is Moonbreaker, including searching for a forgotten weapon in the Museum of Unattached Oddities; or facing off against Grendel Rex, the Unforgiven God, in the hidden heart of the Moon. </p>";
