window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Our universe is but a snow globe—an experiment born of desperation and hope. The true universe is unfathomably vast, teeming with life and untold wonders. And, it is enslaved.</b></p> <p>Created by ancient aliens in a daring gambit to understand the nature of the enemy, humanity is now asked to be the savior of a universe not their own. If they are to succeed, they must rise above not only their fractious past but the sins of their genetic ancestors to boldly embrace a future they never dared imagine possible.</p> <p><b>Book Seven - </b><b><i>Relativity</i></b></p> <p>It's a suicide mission, without a doubt. Alex Solovy and Caleb Marano must steal crucial intelligence from the Anadens' central military headquarters. To succeed, they'll need to navigate a strange universe ruled by a cabal of powerful immortals, populated by aliens they've never met and fueled by technology they've never seen. They're going to need a little help—the kind of help only a suicidally defiant anarchist on the run from more than just personal demons can provide.</p> <p><b>Book Eight - </b><b><i>Rubicon</i></b></p> <p>The Anaden Directorate has ruled Amaranthe for millennia, subjugating species and galaxies in a never-ending quest for control and order. For as many millennia, the anarchs have rebelled, defiantly claiming their own freedom yet without hope of winning it for everyone. Now, an alliance with humans offers a tantalizing chance to at last defeat their immortal masters. But, can they trust an ally who looks suspiciously like the enemy?</p> <p><b>Book Nine - </b><b><i>Requiem</i></b></p> <p>The end of the world began with a library query...how will it conclude? What began as a chance discovery of an anomalous signal is now a multiverse war between humanity and its genetic ancestors over who controls the levers of life and death.</p>";
