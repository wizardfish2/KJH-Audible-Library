window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Over 30 hours of epic sci-fi adventure</b></p> <p><b>Second trilogy in the Aurora Rhapsody series (</b><b><i>Sidespace</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Dissonance</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Abysm</i></b><b>, and bonus content)</b></p> <p><b>It is a time of accelerating technological change and shifting allegiances as the old rules fall away and the old balance of power is upended. A new world rises - one of unshackled AIs, indestructible starships, ethereal quantum spaces, and potent new weapons - and the race is on to determine who will control its future.</b></p> <p><b><i>Sidespace</i></b></p> <p>Humanity is saved. But its troubles are just beginning. Facing anti-synthetic terrorists who want them dead, power-hungry politicians who want them chained, and a rapidly dwindling number of people they can trust, the Prevos must take their fate into their own hands.</p> <p>In a mosaic of spaces inhabited by fantastical aliens and worlds both beautiful and deadly, Alex and Caleb will be forced to question everything they thought they knew, including the nature of life itself.</p> <p><b><i>Dissonance</i></b></p> <p>As society splinters from within and the Earth Alliance falls to reactionaries, a formidable new player emerges on the galactic stage, one not afraid to do whatever it takes to protect all sentient life - human, artificial, and Prevo. Meanwhile, the search for answers leads Alex and Caleb to the most shocking revelation of all - the true face of the enemy.</p> <p><b><i>Abysm</i></b></p> <p>In the quest to be the masters of their own fate, will humanity rise to become liberators or follow the path of their ancestors into darkness? Aurora's future hangs in the balance as the Earth Alliance goes to war with itself over the right of synthetics and Prevos to exist, while the true enemy is closing in faster than anyone realizes, and they - humanity, the Metigens, and the trillions the Anadens enslave - are all running out of time.</p>";
