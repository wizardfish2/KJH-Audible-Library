To top it all off, the game master in his head couldn’t be <i>any </i>less impressed with his assignment.</p> <p>Someone obviously botched their chances when they chose future-college-dropout Kenny. His opportunity to prove everyone wrong starts now....</p> <p><b>Don't miss this special-edition LitRPG series Omnibus from debut author Theo Hodges.
