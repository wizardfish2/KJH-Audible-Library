It doesn't want men who do any sort of building or fighting or grand design, it seems.</p> <p>So, when Leo finds his current girlfriend and boss being threatened by a brutal loan shark and all three of them get dragged through a portal to another world, it doesn't take long for him to decide this is the place for him. Plus, everyone has magic, and who wouldn't want that?</p> <p>Leo appears in the realm of a fallen kingdom, one that desperately needs someone who will both fight for what's right and build a grand civilization.</p> <p>Along with his new coterie of friends—a not-quite-a-princess elf and a crippled dragon—Leo must race to build his kingdom before the loan shark Kruegar can finish Leo off with a legion of orcs.</p> <p>[A litRPG adventure with kingdom-building, base-building, some slice of life, and a whole lot of quipping. Also, an in-depth magic system, leveling options, and an empire chart system. Check out the audiobook that has received over half a million views on RoyalRoad!]</p>";
