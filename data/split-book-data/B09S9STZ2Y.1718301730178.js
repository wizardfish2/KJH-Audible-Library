Promoted to level two with no time to recover, he has gained access to all Helltek has to offer. Life on the campus could be perfect except that Cyber Squad is one of the most high-risk jobs in the world. If the murderous AI wasn’t bad enough, the hackers who attacked TSOTA are up to no good, and a traitor within the Cyber Squad is helping them. Nothing and no one are what they seem. Not even Alice, Kai’s dream girl, who’s way more mysterious than he would have thought. Kai soon finds himself in the center of a massive conspiracy.</p> <p><b>Luckily his team members have his back. But, will it be enough to beat forces as powerful as they’re malicious? The LitRPG adventure continues!</b></p>";
