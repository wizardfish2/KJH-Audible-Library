window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Chaos ensues as the greatest wizard in all the land faces his toughest challenge yet—himself—in this gripping conclusion to the hilarious Hat Trick trilogy.</b></p> <p>Absalom Scryne isn't himself. On the one hand, he's a well-rounded gentleman of a sentient hat with two beloved apprentices and a tagalong swordsman. On the other, he's a rather furious wizard sitting on the opposite side of a desk, demanding they give <i>back</i> his hat. Needless to say, it's not an ideal situation.</p> <p>And it's about to get worse. Because the battle between civilization and all the monsters of the Badlands and the underworld is about to begin. With one Absalom Scryne or another in the human corner, wearing the blue hat, and the dark god Nun Mhor Goth in the monster corner, wearing concentrated darkness, it's going to be a clash for the history books.</p> <p>Facing off against every demonic creature from the previous volumes in the series—plus some extra ones thrown in for fun—our heroes are all too aware the battle could go either way, at the drop of a hat . . .</p>";
