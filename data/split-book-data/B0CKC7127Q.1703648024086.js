Now, the masked crimefighters and criminals who haven’t been allowed&nbsp;to use their powers are being asked to fight to save humanity. And to think, I was just put in prison for just trying to be a good guy.</p> <p>However, with the recent knowledge that the Tuldarians have developed a way of stripping us from superpowers, that could prove more difficult than it seems—in fact, it could be a suicide mission.</p> <p>My name is Sawyer William Vincent (I know, it's three first names. Think I haven't heard that before?) Once known as Red Raptor, I'm now Black Harrier, one of the world's most famous masked crime-fighters. And I’m trying to help stop the&nbsp;end of the world.</p> <p><b><i>Invasion </i></b><b>is the third book in the new Harrier series from Audible number one best-selling author Jaime Castle and CJ Valin, the creators of Raptors.</b></p>";
