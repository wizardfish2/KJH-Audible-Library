They want us to prove we're worthy of ascension and fight alongside them.</p> <p>I don't give a damn about their war. All I want is vengeance on the monster that killed my only family. A monster from their world. And if the only way to kill it is to become a god, then I'm all in.</p> <p>But the path of ascension is paved with dangerous tests, culminating in a lethal trial called the labyrinth of gods.</p> <p>Only an ancient fire elemental has the power to help me survive it.</p> <p>His wicked mouth sets my pulse racing, and his dark threats turn my blood to ice. Charismatic and terrifying, he attracts and repels me in equal measure, and I have no doubt he'd snap my neck in a heartbeat if freed from the magical bonds that compel him to aid me.</p> <p>He hopes to be my undoing, and if I'm not careful, I may not make it to the labyrinth alive.</p> <p>To claim the vengeance that I desire, I'll need to protect my body and shield my mind, but most of all, I'll need to guard my heart.</p> <p><i>Enter an otherworldly realm filled with gods, monsters, and mystical beings. Opposites attract, and love and conflict collide, in this forced proximity romance.</i></p>";
