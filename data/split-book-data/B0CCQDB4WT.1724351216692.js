A member of the famed and prestigious Galactic Rangers, Lennox is charged with keeping the peace in a galaxy that is increasingly torn with tension. He's never failed to put the bad guys away, but his reckless, devil-may-care ways have earned him the wrath of his commanding officers.</p> <p>And yet, a grave threat to galaxy has the brass so scared, they willingly unleash him to find the answers.</p> <p>It’s up to Lennox and Anna—his distractingly beautiful partner—to uncover a hidden threat behind a series of domestic bombings that continue to escalate. Nothing is straightforward with this case, and the more Lennox investigates, the deadlier his opponents become. His discoveries will take him to the very center of power politics, where an insidious plot threatens the very core of the galactic government.</p> <p>Can Lennox and Anna save the day before the treacherous rebels thrust the galaxy into civil war? Or will this be the first time that Lennox fails a mission?</p>";
