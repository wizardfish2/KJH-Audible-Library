window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Tamara Bentley, \"Bent\" to my friends, and I'm not supposed to exist. I was born of the forbidden union between a witch and a werewolf, and they've been trying their damnedest to hide my existence ever since. </p> <p>But now my secret is out, and my uncle, the leader of the wolf pack, is pissed beyond belief. In his eyes, I'm something that should've never been born. He wants me dead and doesn't care who he has to sacrifice to get the job done. </p> <p>I'm far from helpless, though. Not only am I a champion athlete, but I'm strong enough to punch out a bus. Good thing, too, because a rare lunar event is about to increase my uncle's already terrifying power. I'll have to call on every last ounce of strength I have if I want to survive the night and save the lives of everyone counting on me.</p>";
