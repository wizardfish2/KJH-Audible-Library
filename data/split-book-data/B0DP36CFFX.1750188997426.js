Not only do the contestants have to struggle against the Arketh-Takshi—a group of intergalactic vampiric pirates residing within scattered portals—but also with private outworlder factions whose motivations are anything but clear.</p> <p>Not to mention some threats that originate a little closer to home.</p> <p>With the board stacked against him, and a target on his back, will Benny have the strength to pay the price of survival to become a powerful cultivator and a bulwark for his people? Or will the cost prove too high, leaving him nothing but a rampaging monster, devoid of humanity?</p> <p>The stage has been reset. The contestants stand ready. The galaxy watches on.</p> <p>Welcome back to the Game of Souls.</p>";
