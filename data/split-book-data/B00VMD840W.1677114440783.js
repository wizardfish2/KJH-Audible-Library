window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jodi Taylor’s best-selling series <i>The Chronicles of St Mary</i> is back with a bang…. </p> <p>St. Mary’s has been rebuilt ,and it’s business as usual for the history department. But first there’s the little matter of a 17th-century ghost that only Mr. Markham can see. Not to mention the minor inconvenience of being trapped in the Great Fire of London…and an unfortunately timed comfort break at Thermopylae, leaving the fate of the Western world hanging in the balance. </p> <p>Rejoin Max’s madcap journey through time in Jodi Taylor’s fifth interdimensional instalment <i>No Time Like the Past</i>. </p> <p>Jodi Taylor, International Woman of Mystery, spent some time working undercover for North Yorkshire County Library Service. Heavily disguised as the world's most incompetent facilities manager, she shifted dead dogs, fell out of mobile libraries, and spent far too much time in the gents' toilets. </p> <p>The idea to rewrite history first came to her while studying history A level at an evening class. <i>Just One Damned Thing After Another</i> is her first novel and was originally self-published as an e-book; it was downloaded by more than 60,000 readers on Amazon.</p>";
