The Nightstalkers are back, and the world needs them now more than ever. </p> <p>When a real-life truth serum, a military cabal bent on launching a preemptive strike against America’s enemies, and the nuclear football - which contains the information the President needs to launch the nation's missiles - all converge, the Nightstalkers suit up for another deadly mission. Joining forces with the Cellar, the covert world’s police force, the team might be mankind's last hope. </p> <p>A bombed-out neighborhood in Pakistan. A strip mall in suburban Virginia.

The highest-security location inside the White House. <i>The Book of Truths</i> hits all the hotspots and roars to a breathless showdown that could mean the beginning of the end for everyone.</p>";
