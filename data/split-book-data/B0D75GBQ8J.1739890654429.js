They enslave the world with steel—I'll crush them with it.</p> <p>I was shredding a monster guitar solo then died on stage in a freak accident. Reborn, I discovered I was a mage with the power to control metal and kick ass! The Goddess of Chaos has set me loose in the Shimmerlands, a magic world under threat by a total buzzkill named Lord Manageer. He's banned magic, music, and everything that brings pleasure to the people. He must be stopped.</p> <p>I'm the first to control metal, ever. The oppressors rely on it, and I can crush their armor, war jeeps, and buildings like tin foil.</p> <p>With my unique powers, allies are lining up to join my cause. Especially the gorgeous foxgirl blacksmith and the rebellious imp librarian.</p> <p>In a world of metal—only I can rip it wide open to save the Shimmerlands.</p>";
