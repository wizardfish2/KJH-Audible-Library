She’s sharing a soul with one of them. Growing up as a mortal street rat, she only knew a few things: they loved power, hierarchies, and respect. She was at the bottom of the food chain. She was never supposed to amount to much. But she refuses to accept her fate. She’ll do anything to rise above her circumstances, including forming a pact with a rebellious goddess to kickstart her climb to the top. She’s stepping into a wider world, with power struggles beyond what she could ever imagine. Only one thing’s certain: it’s time to take charge of her life, or die trying.</p> <p>About the series: Godscourge is a weak to strong, cultivation- and xianxia-inspired adventure. Step into a seafaring fantasy world with magic ships, god-emperors, and an underdog main character. Perfect for fans of the Weirkey Chronicles, Cradle, and Beneath the Dragoneye Moons.</p>";
