But when his beloved Mary passed away unexpectedly the year before, it was difficult for Elmer to summon the same sort of enthusiasm in decorating for all of the holidays without her beside him.<br> <br> However, due to an accident at work, Elmer’s soul is transported to a strange world, where it inhabits an even stranger object called a Dungeon Core. Soon after his arrival, the new Dungeon Core discovers something he didn’t think was possible: a way to reconnect with the soul of his wife, Mary.<br> <br> In order to do that, though, Elmer will need to survive and increase the Level of his newly acquired form. Unfortunately, he doesn’t know much about fantasy worlds, magic, and monsters; what he <i>does</i> know a lot about, however, are holidays. With the help of a North Pole Elf helper named Keebles, the brand-new Dungeon Core protect his dungeon from a variety of threats by utilizing that holiday-based knowledge while he acquires enough strength to free his wife’s soul.<br> <br> <i>The Holiday Dungeon Core series is a collection of novellas set in a unique universe that contains LitRPG and Dungeon Core elements such as stats and character progression. Contains no foul language, sexual content, or harems.</i></p>";
