A ring sits on his finger, but it's no ordinary ring. It's alien tech designed to improve its host’s strength, speed, agility, durability and combat instinct. Not all boons are infinitely wondrous. This tech has to understand what Josh needs for it to evolve, and time is of the essence.</p> <p>An evil force is rising in Mythelore and threatening not only the land’s entire way of life but also Josh’s new companions—the lovely Arabella, Elowen, the wildly sexy archaeologist, and Cassandra, a sassy witch with no understanding of her true powers.</p> <p>Only one question remains: Will Josh’s power grow in time to save them?</p>";
