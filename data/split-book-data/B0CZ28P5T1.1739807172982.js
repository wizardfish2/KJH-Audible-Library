Questions of her true origins and significance abound, but the path forward is the same as it is for any mortal: one foot in front of the other. Buried in the dirt is the call of risk, reward, and sacrifice.</p> <p>Time to dig deep, baby.</p> <p>Follow along with her and her Devoted through the building of a mystery cult, the creation of supernatural Servitors, and the discovery of new powers and power levels. Persistent threats and new enemies are there to hinder, and the past haunts them all the while, but the future is the domain of Fate and the Fortuneteller knows what is written in the stars.</p>";
