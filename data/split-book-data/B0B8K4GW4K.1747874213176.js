window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The team has done everything right. They have killed off all of Adhava’s kids and in doing so denied her reinforcements, but now she has fled into a dungeon.</b></p> <p>Adrian and his team need to hunt her down; track her, find her and then destroy her in an environment she knows, controls and has had time to prepare to kill interlopers. It is not an exercise, as Training Facilities in the Alpha Physic framework have the real chance of death, and with Adhava trying to ambush them at every moment, it is going to be a tough fight.</p> <p>With discipline and luck, they might pull through, and if they do, the reward is a free Albury and a heap of experience that will position Adrian and the team to make the trip to Melbourne. If they fail…there will be no second chances.</p> <p><i>Dungeon</i> is the fifth and penultimate novel in the six-book Alpha Physics series.</p>";
