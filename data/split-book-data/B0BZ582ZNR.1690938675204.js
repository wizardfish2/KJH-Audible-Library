Having taken up the role of Incubus Lord of the Sixth Circle of Hell, you might say I've got a lot on my plate.

But I can do it all. With the help of my friends and the ladies I love, I can achieve anything.</p> <p>Even if the Demon Queen of Wrath and the Goddess of Chastity are trying to trip me up at every turn.</p> <p><b><i>Incubus RA Part 6 </i></b><b>is the longest entry in the series—twice as long as any previous book.
