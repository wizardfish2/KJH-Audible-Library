window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In a realm where might is right and the powerful rule supreme, only an Unbound Hero can withstand the coming storm.</b></p> <p>Escaping the Coherent Realm and crossing the Rift was just the beginning. As Marek steps into the Unbound Realm, Mags and Ashurai at his side, he discovers a world where ancient powers walk the land. The sky brighter, the land broader, everything seems grander than what they'd known in their previous lives.</p> <p>Yet splendor never lasts long. The consequences of their crossing soon catch up. The Rift was more than a magical barrier. It was the site of an endless battle between realms. And though that conflict was fought by the men of old, it was the gods of the East and the West who spurred it on.</p> <p>Old as they are, such grievances rarely subside over time.</p> <p>On this side of the world, the Western gods hold no power. It is Unbound Sages who command the heavens, and it will be them who decide the fate of our heroes. One Sage gifts Ashurai the seed of transformation, while another seeks to guide Marek's path. For Mags' part, the young cultivator finds herself capable of weaving pure essence, her core enhanced by the magic of this new world.</p> <p>Seeking Yuze's ancient Sect brothers, Marek and Mags can only pray that the cultivators still walk a sacred path. For with a realm full of monsters and tyrants in their way, and demons infringing on mankind's domain, Marek and his companions will need every ally they can find.</p> <p><i>Blending epic fantasy and LitRPG, The Twin Realms Apocalypse is ideal for fans of He Who Fights with Monsters, Cradle, and The Beginning After the End.
