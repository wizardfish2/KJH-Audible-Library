The Roaring Mountain clan is known as one the most powerful clans in the entire Nation. Drengr from dozens of other subordinate clans gather in hopes of joining their ranks and bonding with a spirit beast in lifelong companionship.</p> <p>With a new friend in tow, Casey heads to the heart of the Roaring Mountain to both learn more about this path that might lead him to the strength he needs, and maybe a few old friends as well.</p> <p>What new challenges lie along the Drengr’s Road for Casey and his companions? Only the gods know, and even then their vision is clouded.</p> <p>Steelforged Legacy is a progression fantasy, men's romance, western cultivation story that takes heavy inspiration from classic cultivation and combines it with an alternate take on Norse mythology. Even the gods can't always see the future right, and the world it is set in takes advantage of the fact that sometimes, even the Fates can make mistakes.</p>";
