window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Waking up in a theme-park world run amok was a bit rough. But leveling up to be an epic hero, seizing a mountain of treasure, and romancing a bevy of beauties isn't too bad.</b></p> <p>My name is Danny Abbott. I went to bed thinking I had just another day at the office waiting for me. Instead, I find myself in Dungeon World, a planet-wide RPG-themed amusement park. The monsters are real, the perils are deadly, and the people in charge are long since gone.</p> <p>Sure, \"Maintenance Worker\" sounds like a weird job to be stuck with, until I find out that it lets me reroll chests, disable traps, and access the park’s hidden paths and back halls. And then I realize the world is my oyster; I can be rich, I can be powerful, and I can romance as many beautiful, exotic women as I want.</p> <p>Survive. Level. Conquer.</p> <p><b>Warning:</b> This novel is not appropriate for all ages; it contains descriptions of violence, unconventional relationships, and limitless adventure.</p>";
