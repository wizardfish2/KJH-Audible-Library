Micah Silver was a boy picked for greatness. Chosen by the gods to bear a mythic power, he longed to take his place amongst the heroes and legends he grew up reading about.</p> <p>Unfortunately, his primary blessing only allows him to travel into the past by sacrificing his class, wealth, and levels - a psychological burden that Micah is reluctant to shoulder. But, even if Micah is unwilling, fate has a way of forcing you to face your destiny...and running away can cost you everything.</p> <p>Over and over again...</p> <p><b>Experience the start of a time-looping LitRPG series where a reluctant hero is forced to fight against an impossible catastrophe. Using his talents for enchanting items and summoning creatures, he must retrace his steps and grow stronger in a potentially futile effort to prevent tragedy and protect his family.</b></p>";
