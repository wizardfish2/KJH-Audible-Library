But the dragon's heart in his chest will not give in, and it will keep beating steadily. He will not falter.</p> <p>The Blue Blade will never be lowered in surrender. An indomitable will still shines in the eyes of Hadjar Darkhan, the Wind of the Northern Valleys. He'll endure whatever fate throws at him.</p>";
