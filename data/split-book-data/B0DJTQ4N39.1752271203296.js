window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The complete series for a single credit! Pizza, coffee, and a library full of unplayed games. That's the plan, or at least it was supposed to be. Instead, an average gamer finds himself seemingly transported into the world of his favorite game. While some might appreciate that, it's quickly apparent that he isn't in some sort of virtual reality experiment, all of his downloaded mods are active, and the world is likely set to its highest difficulty with permadeath enabled.</p> <p>The good news is that one of the mods enabled has turned all of his favorite NPCs into women while removing the marriage limit of only having one partner. The bad news is that his mastery of the game has limited use when he discovers new elements he never encountered in the game nor any of its mods. And the more he progresses, the more he realizes something else is going on behind the curtains, but he has to focus on survival and keeping his new companions safe before he can uncover the secrets of the world he has been brought to.</p>";
