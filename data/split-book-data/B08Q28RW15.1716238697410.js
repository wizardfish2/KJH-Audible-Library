window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Even the great may fall</b>. </p> <p>Wu Ying's idle winter, one filled with training and recovery, is thrown awry when his Master and Elder Yang return, injured. The Three Seasons poison fills Master Cheng's veins, slowly killing the powerful Elder. His only hope - a rare antidote. But the ingredients for such an antidote are scarce and located in the deepest wilds. </p> <p>Together, Wu Ying and Elder Yang take it upon themselves to embark on a <i>Second Expedition</i> to acquire the necessary materials. It would be a dangerous journey through the State of Wei normally, but in the shadows, enemies await to finish the job. Wu Ying is once again pitched against dark forces as a Sect war looms. </p> <p><i>The Second Expedition</i> is book 4 of the A Thousand Li series which focuses on immortal cultivation, eastern philosophy, wondrous martial art styles, and spirit beasts. The series draws upon the long tradition of wuxia and xianxia works and will thrill those looking for such high flying fantasy. <i>The Second Expedition</i> is written by Tao Wong, the best-selling scifi and fantasy LitRPG author of the System Apocalypse, the Adventures on Brad and the Hidden Wishes series.</p>";
