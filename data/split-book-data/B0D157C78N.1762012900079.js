window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A damaged soul. A madman plotting in the shadows. The city won't stand for long.</p> <p>With the armies of undead slowly encircling Greendown, James Holden doesn't have much time to get behind its walls before the witches and vampires of the northern mountains finish closing in. He'll have to get his lich-cursed apprentice and the rest of their party through hundreds of miles of ghoul-infested forest before it's too late to save the city.</p> <p>Burning through the limits a mortal should have is catching up to James, and unless he can find a way to repair the damage, his magic is as deadly to him as it is to his enemies. In a world where only the strongest get to make the rules, he can't afford to be left behind. He'll need to find a way to keep pace with those he's training, even as the planet's most powerful warriors hunt for his head at the behest of the gods.</p> <p>It's time for the Judge to do something different. James Holden might have to pass Judgment by Jury.</p>";
