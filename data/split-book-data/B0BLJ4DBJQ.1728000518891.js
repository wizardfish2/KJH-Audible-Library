window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One angry young man is about to take a fantasy realm by storm—or by accident—in the hilarious first book of a new series by the author of </b><b><i>Good Boy</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Gabe Skelter has a temper, which he likes to imagine has the effect of causing people to fear and respect him. On the contrary, his pudgy, underdeveloped body and negative personality make him more your standard outcast teenager. Worse still, he kinda knows what a jerkweed he actually is.</p> <p>Then, in the middle of a class trip, Gabe finds himself spirited away to Regaia: a world of magic, mayhem, and nerd-tastic adventure. Naturally, he’s completely ill-prepared. But in this realm, he’s a monstrous, muscular man of action. Unfortunately, he’s still saddled with the frightfully unimpressive brains of a teenage loser.</p> <p>Now, Gabe must make his burly, bulky way in a land where the strong dominate, the powerful rule, and picking a class has nothing to do with algebra . . . and everything to do with survival.</p> <p>Bristling with reckless abandon and antisocial attitude, <i>Big Sneaky Barbarian</i> is <i>Die Hard</i> with dungeons; a must-hear for fans of heavy-hitting action mixed with laugh-out-loud snark—and absolutely <i>loaded</i> with swears.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with almost 100,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
