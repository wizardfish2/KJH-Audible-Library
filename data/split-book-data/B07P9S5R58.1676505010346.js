Just a handful of survivors, and thousands more trapped in deepest slumber, only hours away from death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even as Val embraces the most perilous and noble task of his life, an entire dreadnought filled with enemy soldiers readies itself for the next step in their campaign of conquest, and Earth is the prize they will claim.&nbsp;</p> <p>To bad they didn't see Val coming. No one ever does.</p>";
