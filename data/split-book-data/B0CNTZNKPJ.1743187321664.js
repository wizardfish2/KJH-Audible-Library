Always looking over your shoulder, likely for the rest of your life.</p> <p>When you find a crew that you can trust, you do anything for them. Jason Burke has a crew like that. He would kill for them...and he would die for them. Right now, they need his help, and it will take all of his cunning and skill to bring them home safely. He is alone, without his powerful ship, the <i>Phoenix</i>, and the criminal cartels he’s going up against are some of the most ruthless in the galaxy.</p> <p>For Captain Burke it’s all or nothing: bring his friends home safe...or die trying.</p>";
