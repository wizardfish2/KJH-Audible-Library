window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In his time at Area 51, Mike Turcotte has learned one thing: We are not alone. As part of an elite Special Forces team, the former Green Beret has encountered things that are well beyond human understanding. Now, two ancient rivals from another world are vying to dominate Earth, and Mike and his team must choose which army to side with. The key to averting the crisis lies in a single weapon: Excalibur. The mythical, legendary sword of King Arthur is real and can unlock a galactic power beyond what anyone - human or alien - has ever seen. And Mike must keep it from falling into the wrong hands. </p> <p>The race to recover Excalibur will lead the players all across the globe - from the ancient pyramids to the Great Wall of China, from a fortress on Easter Island to the heights of Mount Everest - in a high-stakes game in which the fate of humanity is the ultimate prize.</p>";
