Every woman I marry gains a similar boost in power.</p> <p>One day, my wives and I will return to my former home as conquerors.</p> <p>As long as the local king doesn’t kill us first.</p> <p><b><i>Castle Core</i></b><b> is a fantasy LitRPG twist on the typical dungeon core story, featuring harem, slice-of-life, and town-building elements.</b></p>";
