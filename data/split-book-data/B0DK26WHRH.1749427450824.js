window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The world changed the day the rifts happened. Trolls, elves, and other races from fantasy and myth emerged into a modern world, bringing magic with them. The world governments worked to segregate these new arrivals into refugee camps, which eventually became the nation of De’Vas. A nation of paranormals.</p> <p>Five years after the rifts first appeared, Asher Grayson was deported, or as he called it exiled, to De’Vas since he could use magic. Now he is trying to carve a life out for himself in District 114. His roommate and best friend is an orc, keeping his dryad boss in line is a full-time job and the local beastkin gang has it out for him. As Ash works to hone his magic and navigate this new world, he finds himself in a dangerous situation involving the darker side of De’Vas. With powerful foes after him, Ash must rely on his magic and friends to survive.</p>";
