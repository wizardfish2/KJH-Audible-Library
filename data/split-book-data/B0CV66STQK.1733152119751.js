window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The world's most powerful ascendant is transformed into his younger self—with no memory of who he truly is—and must harness his forgotten skills to survive.</b></p> <p>While celebrating his latest victory, Exarch Niramyn carelessly lets his guard down. Seeing his chance, the mighty Myzalik—Nym's rival of a thousand years—casts a spell that sends him back to adolescence, with no idea who he really is or how he came to be washed up on the beach of Bloodfin Cove. Fortunately, the kindly Ciana comes along and saves him. But she quickly realizes he's no ordinary child. For one thing, he has magical abilities she's never seen in someone so young. And for another, he can fly.</p> <p>Of course, not everyone welcomes Nym with open arms. When he kills a man who threatens him and Ciana, he's forced to flee into the woods lest anyone should seek vengeance. Winding up in the town of Zoskan, he starts working for Cern the alchemist, and soon his unusual gifts are noted at the local mage's guildhall, his raw power and magical acumen clearly well beyond his years. His training thus begins in earnest, and before he knows it, he's looking for a way to attend the school of magic known as the Academy.</p> <p>But how to afford the tuition? When a local thief blackmails him into breaking into the home of a wealthy noble family, Nym seizes the opportunity to ally himself with them instead. However, his old crime is sure to catch up with him eventually, and he still hasn't discovered who he really is or why he can do what he can do. Will Nym ever regain his lost talents—or will he be stuck in the form of a mageling forever?</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with more than a million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
