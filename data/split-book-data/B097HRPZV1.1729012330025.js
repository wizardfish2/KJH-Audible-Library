window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Precious D.E. points. Staunch believers. One cantankerous beaver.</b></p> <p>Artorian has seen better days. Chased by demons, hunted by the Red Inkquisition, on the run as a fugitive...and he’s spent barely any time in Eternia. Stuck as a tiny noodle dragon and formed into a crown to decorate the heads of Nobility, he is forced to rely on his friends instead of fixing the issues of the world himself.</p> <p>Luckily for everyone else, the plucky grandfather does not know how to quit. If all Artorian can do is wiggle, then he will wiggle fiercely! By unearthing the secrets of the deity system, he’ll find what it takes to make the true tools of victory.</p> <p>Other deities make mere weapons.... Artorian makes Artifacts!</p>";
