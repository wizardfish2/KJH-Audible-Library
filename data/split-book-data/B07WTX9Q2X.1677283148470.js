God after god is fallen and consumed, and each time the terrible dragon-goddess grows stronger.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nebiat has stolen the Spellship, depriving Voria of its strength when she needs it most. But Nebiat's schemes have never been tested by someone like Talifax, and she will finally discover she's not as clever as she believes.&nbsp;</p> <p>One possibility of victory remains. Aran, Nara, and Kazon discover their true purpose, left by the elder god Xal when he planned for his own demise. With this contingency they have one chance to oppose Nefarius. One chance to stop the goddess that will devour everything.&nbsp;</p> <p>If they fail darkness wins, and our universe will be extinguished. Succeeding carries its own price, one Aran must choose for others to live.</p>";
