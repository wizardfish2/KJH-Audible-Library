window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ilea likes punching things. And eating.</b></p> <p>Unfortunately, there aren’t too many career options for hungry brawlers. Instead, the plan is to quit her crappy fast-food job, go to college, and become a fully functioning member of society. Essentially—a fate worse than death.</p> <p>So maybe it's lucky that she wakes up one day in a strange world where a bunch of fantasy monsters are trying to kill her?</p> <p>On the bright side, \"killing those monsters right back\" is now a viable career path! For she soon discovers her new home runs on a set of game-like rules that will allow her to punch things harder than in her wildest dreams. Well, maybe not her <i>wildest </i>dreams, but it’s close.</p> <p>With no quest to follow, no guide to show her the way, and no real desire to be a Hero—Ilea embarks on a journey to discover a world full of magic. Magic she can use to fight even <i>bigger</i> monsters.</p> <p>She’s struggling to survive, has no idea what will happen next, and is loving every minute of it. Except, and sometimes also, when she’s poisoned and/or has set herself on fire. It’s complicated.</p> <p><b>Listen to the story that took Royal Road by storm with more than 60 million views and counting.</b></p>";
