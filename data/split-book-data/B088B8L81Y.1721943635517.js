window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I’m Val Thorvald, and I’m an assassin.</b> </p> <p>When magical bad guys hurt people, I take care of them. Permanently. </p> <p>This doesn’t make me popular with the rest of the magical community — as you can tell from the numerous break-ins and assassination attempts I’ve endured over the years. But thanks to my half-elven blood, a powerful sword named Chopper, and a telepathic tiger with an attitude, I’ve always been able to handle my problems with aplomb. Maybe some cursing and swearing, too, but definitely aplomb. </p> <p>That changes when my boss is afflicted with a mysterious disease, a government agent starts investigating me, and a godforsaken <i>dragon</i> shows up in the middle of my latest job. </p> <p>I’ve taken down vampires, zombies, and ogres, but dragons are way, <i>way</i> more powerful. And it doesn’t look like this one is going to like me. </p> <p>Worse than that, he wants to use his magic to compel me to do his bidding, as if I’m some weak-minded minion. </p> <p>That’s <i>not</i> going to happen. I’d die before being some dragon’s slave. </p> <p>But if I can’t figure out a way to avoid him, save my boss, and get rid of the government spook, I’m screwed. Or dead. Or screwed <i>and</i> dead. And that’s never comfortable. </p> <p>Pick up <i>Sentient Magic</i> today to see if I make it. Even if you don’t care about me, I promise the tiger is cool.</p>";
