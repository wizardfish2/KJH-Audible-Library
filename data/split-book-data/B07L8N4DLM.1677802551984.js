He was born in the wrong age - an era where the world has already grown tame.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the advent of fully immersive virtual reality, however, that’s all going to change.&nbsp;</p> <p>A revolutionary new game - Chronicle - makes much bolder claims than the competition. It offers a perfect simulation in a new world with quests, magic, monsters, and gods - but Chronicle’s biggest draw is something irresistible: While players are logged in, they have extra time to live.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Corbin’s world, he may be average; he may work hard for no recognition; he may never catch a break and he may seem trapped - but a new world brings new opportunities, and extra time presents an extra chance. Perhaps he’ll find that he’s not so average after all.</p>";
