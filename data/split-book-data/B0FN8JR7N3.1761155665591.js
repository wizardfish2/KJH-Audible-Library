window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I thought surviving the war was hard. Turns out, being a celebrity war hero at magic school comes with its own unique challenges.</b></p> <p>Just when I was getting comfortable with my new life at Stoneway Academy, the monsters in the Shadow Wood of Misery decided to get a lot more aggressive, and I can't help but feel like it's my problem to deal with.</p> <p>My social situation has gotten... complicated. My vampire obsessed roommate still insists I'm undead, my demon familiar keeps plotting world domination through the most questionable means necessary, and now I've got to figure out with a certain bossy dragon-girl who claims to hate my guts. Add in a nosy reporter following my every move, and my student life is anything but quiet.</p> <p>But the real problems run deeper than romantic entanglements and monster attacks. There's something rotten in the political landscape of Caldia, and my girls are getting caught in the crossfire. When the academy decides to send students on a hunt for the King of the Forest, I discover that some threats come from much closer to home than the depths of a monster-infested wood.</p> <p>Between dodging marriage-hungry noble families and trying not to let my blood magic turn me back into the weapon I used to be, I've got my hands full. Good thing I've got four incredible witches watching my backâ€”even if one of them is still convinced I'm going to bite her neck.</p> <p><b>Peace might be harder to protect than I thought, but I'll be damned if I let anyone threaten the life I'm building with the women I love.</b></p>";
