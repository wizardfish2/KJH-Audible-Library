window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ralph could be described as a rogue on a good day.</b></p> <p>A bad day involved a lot of cursing, calling him a pirate, or sometimes even having a shoot-out.</p> <p>It wasn't really his fault of course, or so he would have you believe. It was the fault of those who wanted to get in his way of making as much money as possible as a smuggler.</p> <p>His family had been gifted with a letter of marque for the Terran Confed, one that is inherited and has been passed down to him. Essentially, it gives him a lot of loopholes and ways through regulations to be a fantastic smuggler. Or as a legal pirate, a Privateer.</p> <p>The Confed and its neighbors are about to be plunged into a world of war that spans across the entirety of their universe. From the citizens of the Blood to the Scrap-Worlds on the outer edges of the Confed, the life of everyone is going to change.</p> <p>And Ralph?</p> <p>Well, Ralph is about to get a brand new letter of marque to add to his original one, except for the territories of the Blood of Calesat.</p> <p>Ralph Turlan will go from smuggler to Privateer with a commission to burn the enemy to their deck plates all while getting a bonus for every ship he puts out of the war. It's time to go collect Turlan's Toll from anyone who crosses his path.</p> <p>Let's just hope the crew of cast-offs better fit for the isle of misfit toys can come together quickly.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
