window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From David Wong, the writer of the cult sensation </b><b><i>John Dies at the End c</i></b><b>omes another terrifying and hilarious tale of almost Armageddon at the hands of two hopeless heroes.</b></p> <p>Warning: You may have a huge, invisible spider living in your skull. THIS IS NOT A METAPHOR.&nbsp;</p> <p>You will dismiss this as ridiculous fear-mongering. Dismissing things as ridiculous fear-mongering is, in fact, the first symptom of parasitic spider infection - the creature stimulates skepticism, in order to prevent you from seeking a cure. That's just as well, since the \"cure\" involves learning what a chainsaw tastes like. You can't feel the spider, because it controls your nerve endings. You won't even feel it when it breeds. And it will breed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just stay calm, and remember that telling you about the spider situation is <i>not</i> the same as having caused it. I'm just the messenger. Even if I did sort of cause it. Either way, I won't hold it against you if you're upset. I know that's just the spider talking.</p> <p>\"Like an episode of AMC's \"The Walking Dead\" written by Douglas Adams of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" …Imagine a mentally ill narrator describing the zombie apocalypse while drunk, and the end result is unlike any other book of the genre. Seriously, dude, touch it and read it.\" –<i>Washington Post</i></p> <p>\"Kevin Smith's Clerks meets H.P. Lovecraft in this exceptional thriller… David Wong (Jason Pargin) is a fantastic author with a supernatural talent for humor. If you want a poignant, laugh-out-loud funny, disturbing, ridiculous, self-aware, socially relevant horror novel than <i>This Book is Full of Spiders: Seriously Dude, Don't Touch It</i> is the one and only book for you.\" –<i>SF Signal</i></p>";
