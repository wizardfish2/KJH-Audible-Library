window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Things are always darkest before the dawn.</p> <p>A decade of living alone and broken-hearted has transitioned into a relationship with two beautiful, complex women, with rewards I could never have anticipated. After nearly a year together, Lexie, Olivia, and I are deeply in love and starting to plan our future.</p> <p>But the path to a happy life with the people you love is never as simple as it appears.</p> <p>My plan to send the girls back to school to finish their degrees begins to unravel as it becomes clear that one of them may not get admitted. What I’d planned as a celebratory trip to Hawaii is further complicated by growing attraction between my daughter Maddie and her friend Meredith.</p> <p>As we struggle to navigate these complications, our life is upended by turmoil in Lexie’s family and a cry for help from her younger sister. With so many emotions on a collision course, I’m faced with a decision that could change everything.</p> <p>Bikini Dawn is a multi-POV, explicit, age-gap, menage romance with emotional drama, no cheating/NTR, and a HEA.</p>";
