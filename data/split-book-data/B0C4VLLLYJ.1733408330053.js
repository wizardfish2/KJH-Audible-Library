window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Watch out Montreal. You're in for a fiery ride.</p> <p>I knew three things about my life before adoption: I was a baby rescued from a blazing house fire, I was found in the arms of a dead man, and no one ever came to claim me. No one. Not ever.</p> <p>Now, as a Montreal detective, I'm dedicated to hunting truths for a living. Unheard voices. Cold cases. Unsolved mysteries. Unearthing secrets hidden in the shadows is my jam. Until the fae veil falls . . .</p> <p>When the world learns magic is real, everything changes. Montreal begins seething with prana energy, dormant genes activate, and seemingly normal humans experience magical awakenings.</p> <p>I have an awakening.</p> <p>Suddenly, everything I've obsessed over about my violent beginnings sucker-punches me in the gut. And what's worse-the murderous factions who hunted me so long ago are back on my scent.</p> <p>Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.</p>";
