window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Mythos University welcomes you.</b></p> <p>The Revelation: A name given to an event that, five years ago, changed the world forever. In a single day, humanity discovered that not only were they not alone, but they were not exactly at the top of the food chain.</p> <p>Living in the shadows for millennia, supernaturals now had no choice but to finally come into the light. Because of the fury of a mad god, humans and supernaturals now had to learn to coexist side by side for the first time in living memory. With the revelation that magic was not only real but far more common than fairy tales led them to believe, a new society had to be born.</p> <p>Years after that fateful day, Mythos University stands as the pioneer in a new form of magical education, welcoming the world's best young magic users into its ranks. Humans, werewolves, gnomes? At Mythos, everyone is accepted and treated as equals. A true example of the new society that is emerging.</p> <p>Leo, one of these young people and one of the most powerful supernaturals of his generation, is starting at Mythos as a freshman. Finally stepping out from under his parents' wings, Leo just wants to live like a normal college student: learn magic, train in magical combat, make friends, and maybe even get a girlfriend.</p> <p>But is the 18-year-old dragon, and <i>something more</i>, ready for all the challenges he will face on his journey? Will he be able to keep his secrets at least until the end of the semester, or was his hope of remaining anonymous, just another student among thousands, doomed to fail from the beginning?</p> <p>No one said that being a freshman at the best magic academy in the world was simple and easy, but Leo is always ready for a good challenge.</p>";
