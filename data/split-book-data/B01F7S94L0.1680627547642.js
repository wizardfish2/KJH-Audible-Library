Billions of fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers - all gone, all dead. It is time we end this, for our moment has come. </p> <p>But victory never comes without sacrifice. Heroes are not taught nor trained but forged in blood and ashes. Our grandchildren's history books will tell our story and glorify the heroes and legends. </p> <p>The Swarm will be conquered; we will prevail. At any price. </p>";
