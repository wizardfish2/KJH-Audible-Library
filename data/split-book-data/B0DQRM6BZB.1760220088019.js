And now, the Seventh Heaven beckoned, the place where both the answers to his questions and justice for all those he'd been forced to leave behind awaited him.<br> <br> Not once had he given in, regardless of the obstacles in his path. Even if all the Ancients banded together to oppose him, he would not yield. His will had been forged into something more than mere iron by the crucible of his life, and nothing would be able to break it. His sword would never be lowered in surrender, his stride would forever remain undaunted. He was Hadjar Darkhan, and he would see his goals realized, or he would die trying.</p>";
