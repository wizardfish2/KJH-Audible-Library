Three rounds from the opponents and Hitler takes Europe, Pearl Harbor never happens, a fascist cloud hangs over the postwar United States, and CHRONOS itself is erased from existence.</p> <p>Now Tyson, Madi, and a team of seasoned players must make <i>their</i> moves - in 1930s New York. Jazz and the blues waft from Village clubs. The World’s Fair draws assassins. Madison Square Garden hosts Nazis. And the Manhattan Project never gets off the ground. </p> <p>Tyson and Madi have only three days to undo the strategy that changed the tides of war and the fate of the world. A surprise survivor from CHRONOS could be their best hope for flipping the timeline. <i>If</i> he’s on their side. But can they risk trusting him when the past, the future, and the lives of millions hang in the balance?</p>";
