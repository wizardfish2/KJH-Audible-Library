window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With <i>Worldbinder,</i> the best-selling epic series breaks new ground. </p> <p>After the events of Sons of the Oak, Fallion and Jaz, the sons of the great Earth King Gaborn, are living as fugitives in their own kingdom, newly invaded and secretly controlled by supernatural beings of ultimate evil. The sons are hiding until they can regain their rightful places in the land. </p> <p>Fallion seems destined to heal the world and feels the supernatural calling to act. When he summons his powers to do so, though, two entire worlds collapse into one, and every living thing in both worlds is transformed into an entirely new being - yet still somehow the same. Evil is certainly still the same - and may have influenced all of this for a terrible purpose. </p> <p>David Farland is the pseudonym of Dave Wolverton, an American author of fantasy fiction who lives in Utah with his wife and five children. He was a budding author during his college years but came to prominence when he won the Writers of the Future L. Ron Hubbard Gold Award, for <i>On My Way to Paradise,</i> in 1987. He has achieved much renown in the science fiction field, but fans may know him best as the author of Star Wars novels; <i>The Courtship of Princess Leia</i> was met with acclaim from critics and readers alike and became a <i>New York Times</i> best-selling novel.</p>";
