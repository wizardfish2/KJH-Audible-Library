But increasing undead incursions have them scurrying to keep the monsters that lurk beneath their territory from drawing the ire of the planet-spanning Adventurer's Guild. Along with defense, they must find new allies to strengthen Merideva and improve their chances of survival.</p> <p>Gabriel still grieves for his fallen bonded, but with the other three at his side, he is determined to protect his Core and build the power base needed to crush the Swarm infesting the lowest floors. If they wind up rejuvenating the city of Lostbarrow in the process, he can live with that.</p>";
