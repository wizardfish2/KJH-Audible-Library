Threats higher.</b></p> <p>Glenn Redwood, Town Guard, has steadily gained levels while protecting the Townsfolk of Wolfpine and its young adventurers from monsters.</p> <p>The lives he has saved make his duty worthwhile, and fleeting visits from his childhood sweetheart Becka... now training as a Junior Blazer... makes standing watch a bit more bearable. Glenn is content living a good life among good people. Yet the Gods are far from done with him.</p> <p>When Glennâ€™s old friend, Zack Silverstone, and the fugitive Soulseer, Anna Bronzelight, uncover an ancient threat that could destroy Wolfpine, Rebecca Coldbreaker and her fellow Blazers are called to action once more.</p> <p>Circumstances arranged by the Gods will set Glenn, Zack, and the Blazers on a path that may end up costing all of them their lives.
