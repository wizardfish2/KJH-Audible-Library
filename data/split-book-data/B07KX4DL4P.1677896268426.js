Though if Salchar was expecting a break he’s in for a rude awakening, well he’s already done that once...but anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Lady Fairgate has sensed something has gone wrong at Parnmal. Thinking that Jorsht is now trying to carve out his own little kingdom, she sends Captain Kelu, one of her favourite enforcers with the largest Syndicate Fleet assembled since the Syndicate and the Union went head to head.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Though Kelu is in for some nasty surprises when he reaches Parnmal, Jorsht isn’t home and this little bit of space is defended by the Free Fleet. Salchar and his people are going to have to pull some major tricks out of their hats to survive the defense of Parnmal. It’s time to see if the Free Fleet has what it takes to survive. No matter what the outcome, they're going to make sure no one is going to forget their names.</p>";
