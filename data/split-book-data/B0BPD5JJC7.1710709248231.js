window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Apocalyptic magic shifting the balance of the world. A reality humanity never believed possible. Survival isn’t enough.</b></p> <p>For Ronan, life in the Bunker was seldom exciting. He had spent all of his time trapped below the surface of the Earth, exploring the same floors over and again. Returning to the surface had always been a taboo subject, something that had always clearly not been an option yet was a necessity. When nature itself fights back against exploration, you stay where it’s safe.</p> <p>When a mere inkling of hope appeared, however, Ronan and his friends jumped on the opportunity. On the surface for the first time in a generation, they discover a world changed beyond their imagination. When threatened by the unknown, and against anything that might be considered logical, they recruit the help of one of the things that caused the apocalypse. The group is determined to fight fire, vine, and pickaxe for every scrap of freedom and turn magic to their own devices.</p>";
