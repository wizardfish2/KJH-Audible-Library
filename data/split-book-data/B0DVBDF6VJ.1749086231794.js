On the continent of Elondria, anyone may become the next legendary dragon rider by building the greatest towns, cities, and even kingdoms.</p> <p>Skálda Branwright dreams of leaving the Longcold and becoming the first Dragonlord to build an official realm. Only no dragon egg has ever hatched for her.</p> <p>When a hatchling falls to her from another world, begging for rescue, she must decide whether to surrender her dragon to death or become the worst criminal of all—a rogue rider.</p> <p>But this is no ordinary dragon. By the time Skálda realizes what she holds in her hands, it is much too late.</p> <p>Stealing this hatchling will come at a steep cost—breaking the republic she is sworn to serve... and eliminating the elf that created the rules for Realm-Building. The same war machine that manufactures humans into riders to serve the elves.</p> <p>A Queen will rise out of blood and dragonfire... and this is how it begins.</p> <p><i>Includes</i> A Quest of Rangers, a <i>novella in the Realm Breaker series.</i></p>";
