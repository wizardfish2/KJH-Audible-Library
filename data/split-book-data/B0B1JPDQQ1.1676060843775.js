window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A city on the verge of collapse. Thousands dead or dying. One girl standing at the crossroads of fate.</b></p> <p>Leaving behind bright ballroom lights for a blood-soaked battlefield, Jade is on her way to becoming the hero she never wanted to be. Through the portal, a city on fire beckons, besieged by a flood of monsters. In a race against time to protect what’s left, her only choice is to fight fae above her magic class and shine a light into the darkness.</p> <p>As the smoke clears, Jade learns that the Dark One’s monsters weren’t the only thing she should be wary of. Something none of them were expecting slipped through the cracks. If dealing with nobles concerned more about pride than sense wasn’t bad enough, she’ll have to figure out how to handle the existences that could wipe a crumbling city from the map if she’s not careful: baby dragons.</p> <p>Sometimes, the most dangerous problems fly in on tiny wings.</p>";
