window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sometimes dying isn’t even the worst part of your day.</b></p> <p>Mark’s new life begins in the worst possible place—a burned-out village haunted by undead. Each morning these ravenous creatures disappear, only to return at night, driven by a relentless hunger. He'll need to stay low and think quick, because trapped and alone in the body of a child, he can’t level up in this new world. At least not yet.<br> <br> Soon Mark will learn that even among the living, safety isn’t guaranteed. When the small town that he ends up in turns out to be at the center of a conspiracy that threatens the world, he'll need to uncover the truth before it's too late. Mark will need to find allies, gain levels, and face countless horrors in order to survive his second shot at life and prove that he's more than just a bog-standard hero...</p> <p><i>With over 4 million views on Royal Road, this is no ordinary LitRPG. Bog Standard Isekai is a slow-burn, incremental, magical progression fantasy containing slice-of-life elements punctuated by moments of intense violence.</i></p>";
