With the Bradley Fighting Vehicle in their possession, he couldn’t help but wonder what could possibly be a real challenge in the future.</p> <p>Alvin made the decision that they would all take a few days to learn what the Bradley was capable of before they ventured further east. Its Bushmaster gun delivered a hell of a kick to anything with armor, though Alvin wondered how they could acquire TOW missiles or high-explosive ammunition to boost their damage even more.</p> <p>After Alvin and his group wiped a miniboss out without so much as breaking a sweat, Alvin should have been expecting more changes to the game he now inhabited. After all, he seemed to be a nexus of Dev-elopments as the game went on.</p> <p><i>This book contains adult situations, in all their horror and glory, including but not limited to sex, abuse, drug use, and murder. It also contains graphic sex scenes, which portray elements of BDSM and harem. You've been warned.</i></p>";
