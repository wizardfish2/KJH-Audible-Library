So I had to develop more mundane skills, skills which have taken me across the globe on dangerous missions.</p> <p>But there are some missions I’ve always had to refuse. I've never been able to take on a super. They're just too powerful. They're gods, whereas I'm just a man, even with all my knowledge and training.</p> <p>All that changes after I discover my dad's secret research project.
