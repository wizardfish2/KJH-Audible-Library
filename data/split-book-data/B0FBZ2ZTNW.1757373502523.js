But even on another world, around people that worked magic into their everyday life but owed their allegiance to the Norse gods of old, one truth remains:</p> <p>You can’t fix stupid.</p> <p>Thankfully, it’s possible to muffle the idiocy of people that he doesn’t want to deal with, as long as Casey keeps moving. All except for the bit of four-legged mischief that has decided to follow him.</p> <p>After his last battle—in which Casey was forced to face off against a young master to the Bronze Fist clan—Casey now has a friend to talk to besides his lover, Maude. Though the looks he might draw from talking to an elk are about as strange as the ones he was getting for conversing with his weapon.</p> <p>The young Gladewalker Elk, a fantastical creature that hunters prize as one of the greatest types of prey, has decided to tag along with Casey’s adventures. Now whether that is to repay the favor, or because he likes the snacks that Casey has with him is entirely up to the judgment of the observer.</p> <p>As a trio of misfits, Casey, Maude, and the Gladewalker Elk have to find a way to slip out of the Bronze Fist lands before someone notices the missing scion and figures out what happened to him. All while still moving north, drawn by the call of the Roaring Mountain clan, where Casey hopes to reunite with his friend Einar.</p> <p>Steelforged Legacy is a progression fantasy, men's romance, western cultivation story that takes heavy inspiration from classic cultivation and combines it with an alternate take on Norse mythology. Even the gods can't always see the future right, and the world it is set in takes advantage of the fact that sometimes, even the Fates can make mistakes.</p>";
