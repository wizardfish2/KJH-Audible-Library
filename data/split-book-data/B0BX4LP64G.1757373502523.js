Then, during a deadly trainwreck, he was transported to another reality. On the world of Regaia, Gabe is a different person entirely: a massively jacked-up warrior orc known as Loon. The dud has become a stud.</p> <p>But even in his new buff bod and with his growing collection of skills, Gabe still finds himself in a near-constant fight for survival against a wide variety of horrific creatures. Luckily, he's gathered a small but loyal band of fighters to cover his broad back. And he's going to need them . . .</p> <p>Because the powers that brought Gabe to Regaia have their own plans for him and his former classmates who \"died\" in the trainwreck—now known as <i>sojourners</i>. Plans that could have drastic consequences not only for Gabe's loved ones but for all Regaia. Plans that will almost certainly get them all killed.</p> <p>Packed with furious combat, nerd-tastic detail, and hilarious wit,</p> <p><i>Big Sneaky Barbarian 2</i> is a must-listen for fans of high-octane action and nonstop smart-ass fun.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 100,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p> <p><i>Includes a special note from the author.</i></p>";
