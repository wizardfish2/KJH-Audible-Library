Pretty impressive, honestly. That was until a three-inch tall sprite emerged from his coffee mug and told him he was a wizard. Scratch that—a warlock. Apparently there's a difference, and that difference involves stuff we probably shouldn't go into in this good Christian blurb.</p> <p>Now he's at Thistlewick School of Wizardcraft and Witchery, which happens to be in a magical land called Everafter. Much to his dismay, Everafter has a problem; specifically, a reproduction problem. Thus, he finds himself surrounded by monster girl co-eds who happen to be conveniently inexperienced with boys. First, he meets Tizzy, an adorable lisping jackalope girl, but she's just the first of many monster cuties that he ends up entangled with. Sphinxes, valkyries, fairies, oh my! It's a good thing stamina is one of Reggie's \"warlocky\" strengths.</p> <p>Oh, and he has less than a week to brush up on two years of magical curriculum and pass the placement exam or he'll be held back when the semester starts while his new lady friends move on to their third year without him.</p> <p>No pressure or anything.</p> <p><i>Summoner Summer Camp</i> is a progression-filled romp about a guy trying to ace his exams while his overeager cabinmates treat him like a walking mana dispenser. Do not listen while in line at the bank.</p>";
