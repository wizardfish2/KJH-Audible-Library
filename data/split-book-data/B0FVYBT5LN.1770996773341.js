Having a gluttonous fiend for a pet.</b><br> <br> When scholar and spell-caster Professor Croft trapped a succubus in a kitten’s body, he believed he was being merciful. His reward two years on? A morbidly obese cat with a lethal attitude.<br> <br> When Tabitha isn’t busy lounging, gorging on delicacies, or honing her insults, she’s devising ways to devour his well-meaning soul.<br> <br> But as supernatural mysteries pop up in the city—from a haunting on Roosevelt Island to a monster lurking in a child’s closet in Brooklyn—Prof Croft dares to consider that Tabitha’s unique makeup might <i>actually</i> be an asset.<br> <br> Can he convince his ginger adversary to shelve their differences long enough to solve cases and save innocent lives? Or will Tabitha insist she has better things to do?<br> <br> Like shredding his favorite reading chair.<br> <br> <b>Set before the main books in the Prof Croft series, this complete collection of mini-adventures can be enjoyed on its own. If you like snarky cats, fledgling mages, and supernatural investigations, you're sure to love Croft &amp; Tabby!</b></p>";
