Freedom is balanced against the promise of tomorrow.</b></p> <p>Argrave's harrowing journey to the Burnt Desert left him at death’s door, but breathed new life into his group by adding a fresh face to the party… if a severed head on a stick can be considered a proper companion. His goal is in sight within this foreign land with a tradition of hostility, and the royal bastard stands at the cusp of becoming black-blooded.</p> <p>All of the magic, components, and requisite skills are close at hand. But the closer the team gets to their desires, the tighter the web of impending conflict tightens around them—a web woven with the threads of zealous devotion by the god Fellhorn’s despotic followers. Even with how hard they struggle to succeed, there’s no way to know if the inscrutable, unstable Alchemist will be willing to perform the procedure or eradicate them on the spot.</p> <p>Just as worrisome is knowing that even if they can convince the Alchemist to take the job, he can demand any price for his services: body, mind, or even soul.</p>";
