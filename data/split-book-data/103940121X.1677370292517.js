window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The mission should have been a few simple weeks exploring uninhabited wilderness. But now Tristan is stuck in a land filled with wild women, exotic magic, and dark dangers.</b></p> <p>His beautiful commander - his only way back, and the only person who has any faith in him - has caught the eye of a freakish crime lord backed by a shadowy cult. Tristan has his own magic, but to save them both, he'll need to confront his doubts and bind willing women brandishing destructive fallen powers. If Tristan succeeds, will he even want to return? It's a question as unsettling as his enemy, and one he can only answer after defeating the rising tide of foes.</p> <p>To win he will need to do more than ride a bound storm - he has to unleash its fury himself.</p> <p><i>Contains some graphic violence and explicit harem relationships. Only vanquished foes fade to black.</i></p>";
