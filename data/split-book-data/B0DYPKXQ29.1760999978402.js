After losing his high-level character in his favorite MMORPG, Major Online, he thinks he’s done with gaming for good. But when a mysterious coin from a street vendor opens a portal to a new world, he’s thrust into a reality that combines magic, monsters, and the most intense leveling grind he’s ever experienced.</p> <p>Now, in the unfamiliar world of Omono, Eric finds himself in the Mortal Realm, a place where cultivation isn’t just a game mechanic–it’s the key to survival. Armed with only basic ki powers and a deep desire to avoid dying, Eric must navigate strange creatures, powerful allies, and the confusing rules of a world where spiritual energy is as important as combat skills.</p> <p>To level up, Eric must face monsters, gather spiritual essence, and learn to control his newfound powers. But with no manual, no team of experienced players to guide him, and the constant threat of stronger creatures around every corner, Eric’s journey is anything but smooth.</p> <p>Will he find his way to god-like power, or will this new world break him before he can even figure out how to level up? One thing’s for sure–it's not all about stats and quests here, and Eric’s about to learn that the hard way.</p>";
