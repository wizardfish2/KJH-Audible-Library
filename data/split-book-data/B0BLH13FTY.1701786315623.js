window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Michael Freeman is a disabled veteran who had just been fired from his mind-numbing cubicle job, which allowed his opportunistic girlfriend to dump him. Now, he only wants to spend some time at his grandfather's mountain cabin so he can unwind, away from the drudgery of daily life and with a cold beer in his hands.</p> <p>Standing in his way is an ancient spaceship with an emotional AI, nanites that have invaded his body, an international crime syndicate, a suicidal FBI agent on a vigilante mission, terrorists . . . and that's just the beginning.</p> <p>What can one man do when faced with insurmountable odds? Call it quits? Or . . . call some of his old army buddies and blow those obstacles to smithereens?</p> <p>Can he become more than he had ever dreamed, reaching further than any man before? Staying under the radar of the powers that be while righting a few wrongs of the modern world.</p> <p>He is sure of three things: 1. He really doesn't want to follow the rules anymore . . . aside from his own; 2. Space is the ultimate frontier, and he had been given a turnkey technology to reach it—if they let him; and 3. Those that want to hurt him and the people he cares about will rue the day they were born.</p>";
