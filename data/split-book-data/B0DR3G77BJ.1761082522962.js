After banishing the avatar of a fallen god, my vessels well deserve their rest... and we'd all like a chance to grieve the fallen.</p> <p>Yet after an encounter with an assassin in Viatross, our group is bound to head south, far south to Ferendell. Cormac Alchemist IX has summoned me. The man wishes to take back Rael, the Divine Artifact he gifted Astra. Regardless of his desires, I've sworn to protect this land I love. So be it in peace or battle, I will meet Cormac in the grand city of Ferendell.</p> <p>What the man doesn't know is that I've progressed faster than he could have anticipated. Walk with care, cultivator, for Rinmarron, the Runesmith of Bern, is coming for you.</p> <p><b><i>The Reincarnated Core Volume 6</i></b></p> <p>A fallen tyrant. Five towers restored. Yet the battle between Shadow and Light has only yet begun.</p> <p>With Cormac out of the way, Chaski and her army of vessels are working harder than ever to restore the peace their previous master had squandered away. Ferendell's council plots day and night, striving to create stability in a crumbling world.</p> <p>Given a brief window, I will take my vessels back to Pine Mountain, back to the ranch house we left in Bern. With so much on the line, I can only hope Grandmaster Adan has done his best in preparing my apprentice Pim.</p> <p>Feasts and festivals will abound, and the girls can finally let down their hair to relax. If it were up to me, I would give them a lifetime of such peace. Fate remains impatient, though, and the storm sweeping across Acalia must be stopped.</p> <p>Old alliances and new friendships will be tested as we work to quell an unexpected problem. Then, all will join hands and march on the Shadow Tower, the onyx pillar to the north that so many fear.</p> <p>Towers above, lend us your light, for never before have we been so sorely tested.</p> <p><b><i>The Reincarnated Core Volume 7</i></b></p> <p>Avatars to conquer, the seeds of the Shadow Tower to collect, and one final obstacle: the lofty Tower of Lights.</p> <p>Dark visions haunt Rin's mind as the tension in Acalia rises. Will the nations of this magical land come together, or will their feuds and blood wars lead them astray? With the world's strongest cultivator leading the cause, unity might be possible at last.</p> <p>Rin and his girls have many goodbyes to make. Their world will be ending soon, one way or another. With such heavy burdens upon their shoulders, the seven adventurers make sure to find joy in every stolen moment.</p> <p>For it wasn't power, wealth, or treasure that Rin found in Acalia. No, the true prize was love and friendship. Such bonds are strong enough to defy the divine, complete an unlikely quest, and seek a new life in the great beyond.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
