Parades, booze, beads, and missing people turning into zombies. Zombies only another necromancer could have created. Taking him out should be no problem for the Pale Horseman, except this one seems to know everything about Laz's life, maybe even better than he knows himself.</p> <p>Nothing is sacred to a psychotic killer armed with necromancy, including Lazarus' family. Pulled into a deadly game of cat and mouse with a deranged killer, Laz must choose between becoming what he fears most or handing his life over to a madman. One with a disturbingly familiar face . . .</p>";
