Built on corruption, lies, and injustice for all.</p> <p>An unlikely answer comes to him that fits his wounded heart.</p> <p>Justice handed out by him personally. Vengeance and retribution in equal measure to all that deserve it.</p> <p>Using his newfound powers and unbending determination, Warner is going to carve a path through the world that’ll send the darkest corners of existence fleeing before him. Even as he crushes them beneath his furious strikes.</p> <p>The very world will tremble with his actions and fear his coming.</p> <p><b>Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show.
