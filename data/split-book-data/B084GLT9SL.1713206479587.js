window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After visiting Nevada, California, and two apocalypse gates, Alvin was tired. With Gothy, and now Kuro, beside him, they faced necromancers, an undead army, and saved a queen from assassination. Alvin could only wonder what was going to be thrown at them next!</p> <p>First, however, a vacation was in order. Returning to Green River, seeing the first settlement he had helped build, and revisiting old friends was cathartic. Alvin knew that he would not be able to stay long, as something was bound to happen to push them back on the road again.</p> <p>Alvin had to decide where they would go next, and had narrowed it down to two choices - south into Texas, or head north and east into Colorado and, maybe, the Great Lakes. </p> <p>Either choice would mean meeting new friends, new enemies, or both.</p> <p><b>Warning: This book contains adult situations, in all their horror and glory, including but not limited to: sex, abuse, drug use, and murder. It also contains graphic sex scenes, which portray elements of BDSM and harem. Youâ€™ve been warned.</b></p>";
