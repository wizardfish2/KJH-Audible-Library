The Hellmarine and his squad are sent in to contain the chaos, but this time, the stakes are personal. As memories of a forgotten past claw their way to the surface, the unstoppable juggernaut finds himself haunted by more than just demons.</p> <p>With the Overmaiden orchestrating from the skies, Seraphiel watching his back, and a mysterious face from his old life stirring questions he’s not ready to answer, the Hellmarine must carve his way through legions of profane ice monsters to stop a Voivode powerful enough to warp reality itself.</p> <p>But this isn’t just war anymore—it’s survival. The cold burns, the ice corrupts, and the Hellmarine’s unyielding rage might not be enough to save Asarus...or himself.</p> <p>And that's only the opening chapters.</p> <p><i>Hellmarine 2: Neck Deep in Demon Blood</i> takes the carnage and chaos to the next level with more action, more lore, and more Hellmarine fury. The fight for humanity’s future has never been deadlier—or more personal.</p>";
