window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Light strives to purify the kingdom of Starevos from evil...and only Dungeon Lord Edward Wright stands in their way.</p> <p>The Heroes of the Militant Church, led by Inquisitor Gallio, scour the forest in search of the Haunt, while Ed desperately attempts to uncover the secret behind the Heroes' origin. Can Ed and his friends defeat the Inquisition and secure their own place in the world, or are they destined to become the monsters of their own tale?</p> <p>All over Ivalis, the portents announce blood and fire as the ancient traditions return and abominable creatures long thought forgotten stir in their tombs. Both the Dark and the Light loom hungrily over the Haunt, and only one thing is certain...</p> <p>If pushed, Dungeon Lord Edward Wright will fight against them all.</p> <p>Soundbooth Theater is proud to present the third book of Hugo Huesca's horror/comedy/Gamelit epic, The Wraith's Haunt.
