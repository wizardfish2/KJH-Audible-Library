window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Alice Long, and I've always known I was different. </p> <p>When I was little I used to climb up to the highest branches of the housetree at night, and watch the starships docking at the orbital stations high above. Forty meters off the ground, watching ships 30,000 kilometers overhead, with senses that could pick out radar pings and comm chatter as easily as the ships themselves. It all seemed perfectly natural at the time. </p> <p>There were other kids with mods at the orphanage, but nothing like that. I learned fast to downplay my abilities, keep my mouth shut, and try to blend in. Even as a kid I knew not to trust the Matrons. What would they do if they realized the Adjustments that were supposed to make me a meek little herd animal didn't do anything? </p> <p>Then I messed up and gave myself away. </p> <p>Now I'm on the run, hoping against hope that the Matrons won't try too hard to find me. Hoping to survive all the awful things that can happen to a girl on her own in space. Kidnappers, slavers, pirates, and yakuza - no matter where I go, trouble always seems to find me. </p> <p>Good thing I'm not as helpless as I look. </p>";
