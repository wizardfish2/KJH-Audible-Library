I learned a long time ago the key to survival is keeping a low profile. But it's hard to ignore an artifact of the gods powerful enough to blow holes in reality. </p> <p>Enter stalker werewolves in a black Mercedes and magicians trying to capture me. They all think I know where the damned statue is. Then I'm attacked by demons. </p> <p>It wouldn't be so bad, but some of them are really rude. Being rude is a capital crime where I come from. </p> <p>Time for a lesson in manners. </p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
