window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>D.E.D. Exorcists is the latest Augmented Reality mobile game focused on capturing, collecting, and training teams of Digitally Energized Demons. For an ordinary college student like Henry, who has always loved monster-taming RPGs, it looks like the perfect game. At least, until he downloads it.</p> <p>Now, the monsters are real.</p> <p>Henry finds himself forcibly recruited into the very real D.E.D. Exorcists: a shadow organization capable of capturing, training, and subduing the real-life demons that are invading Earth. These creatures’ powers and abilities are beyond Henry’s wildest dreams, as he’s yanked out of his mundane life and into the world of magic, monsters, and dark secrets.</p> <p>In his new role as an Exorcist, Henry must use every ounce of his monster training know-how, garnered from a lifetime of gaming, to strengthen his D.E.D., and protect his city.</p> <p>But his new life comes with a heavy cost. The Exorcists may not be all they seem. Danger lurks in the shadows all around him, and Henry quickly finds himself questioning who, and what, he can trust.</p>";
