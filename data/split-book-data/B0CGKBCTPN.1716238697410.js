That System is gone now, replaced by a new one that's cold and unfeeling. And to make matters worse, the darkling are stronger than ever before.</p> <p>The three princes—Nieven, Tigris, and a new monster named Mirugo—are forcing their race to march up the tower at sword point, sacrificing thousands of their own to claim new powers and rewards.</p> <p>Humanity has no choice but to follow.
