I saw a flash of light in the sky, blinked to get a better look.</p> <p>Bright lights from my side. A horn honking. A woman screaming.</p> <p>Join me, I'll tell you the rest. Basically, this ex-succubus comes along, ropes me into a whole ordeal that involves fighting off her old team of supervillains or aliens, whatever you want to call them.</p> <p>Just the two of us? No way in hell! We had to form a team first, and what a team!</p> <p>But I won't spoil the fun for you, friend. Listen on. Enjoy.</p> <p><i>Note: If you aren't familiar with harem elements in a story, well, sit down.... You might get light-headed. Try not to drool.</i></p>";
