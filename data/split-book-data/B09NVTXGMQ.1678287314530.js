window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Have you ever felt like there was something inside of you pushing your actions? A dormant beast, so to speak. I know it sounds crazy.</b></p> <p>But, that’s the best way I could describe how I’ve felt for a long time. I thought it was normal, some animal part of the human brain that lingered from evolution. But, this is the story of how I learned I wasn’t exactly human, and there was a world underneath our own where all the things that go bump in the night live. And, that my beast was very real indeed.</p> <p>Of course, my first steps into this new unknown world are full of problems. I didn’t know the rules, landing me on the wrong side of a werewolf pack and in a duel to the death with a smug elf.</p> <p>But, at least, I have a few new friends in the form of a dark elf vampiress and a kitsune assassin as I try to figure out just what I am, and more importantly, learn to control it.</p>";
