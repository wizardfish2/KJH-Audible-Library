window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Exciting 5th Installment of Arcane Knight!</b></p> <p>Welcome to the planet of Wyrd. Long ago a race known only as the 'Ordu' brought Order to a planet of Chaos. Now the two forces are locked in an eternal struggle for power.</p> <p>A select few are given full access to a System meant to empower beings of Order. However, not all who are born into this world have that special something, called a 'Spark' by the locals, to be Awoken and live the life of an Adventurer.</p> <p>Caldor is your average farm boy who dreams of great adventures and the thrill of monster hunting. You see, his father, a Famed Adventurer and Hero of the Battle at Lynsteen Pass, was an Arcane Knight and Caldor won't accept a mundane life and believes that he too is destined for great things. After he's told his father died during the Battle at Lynsteen Pass, he is mentored by his father's best friend, Warrick the Wizard.</p> <p>But something strange happens when Warrick has to suddenly disappear for a secret task that will change Caldor's future forever. While out hunting he feels something that can only be described as a 'Spark'. Finally, getting what he's always dreamed of, Caldor must deal with the reality of being an Adventurer and try not to drown against the sudden overwhelming responsibility that so many wish to thrust upon him.</p> <p>The politics, secret maneuverings, and responsibilities are abound, but Caldor just wants to be a simple adventurer. Join him as he gives it his best shot.</p>";
