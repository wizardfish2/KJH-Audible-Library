window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Epic adventures, sexy ladies, and awesome dinosaurs!</p> <p>Three big audiobooks all in one great place.</p> <p>Nate is the hardworking CEO of SouthernCool, an AC company in Florida. After years of toiling to get rich, he finally takes a well-deserved vacation to Australia. A chance encounter ties him to a gorgeous gal named Senna. Right as things between the two are heating up on the Great Barrier Reef, pesky aliens intervene.</p> <p>Humanity is doomed, they tell him, destined to become extinct in the not-too-distant future. Nate and Senna are forced to compete for a spot on a human preserve. The competition turns out to be similar to a Real Time Strategy (RTS) 4x game. That means, in order to score points, you have to eXpand your empire, eXterminate your foes, and eXplore and eXploit your environment.</p> <p><b>Warning: </b>Contains nontraditional relationships, adult interactions that would steam up the windows of an old pickup truck, and violent action. 18+ recommended.</p>";
