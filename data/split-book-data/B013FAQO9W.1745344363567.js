But even back then, sorcerer Nate Garrett, aka Hellequin, knew there was more to it than simple savage pleasureâ€”souls were being stolen.</p> <p>Nate's discovery of the souls' use, and of those supporting the group's plan, made him question everything he believed.</p> <p>Now the group Nate thought long dead is back.
