window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Alex has taken firm control over his county as the count of Brit. By and large, everything has settled into a fairly normal pattern for him, his Numbered, and his wife. The problem of course is there's still an ongoing war between two duchies, and Regina Tanulf, Alex's liege and lord, has plans for him. Plans that he wants no part of. Except that he doesn't really have a choice in the matter. Everything begins to spin back out of control as a messenger from the Wild Lands arrives with a plea for help. It's time for Alex to get back to work. Because Leah still owns his soul, and if he wants to keep it safe, he needs to make deals in his favor, in her name.</p>";
