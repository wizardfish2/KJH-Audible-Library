But when my older brother gets killed in a car accident, I’ve got to come back to take over his car-tuning business.</p> <p>But things are not like I remember. There’s something weird going on in Santo Domingo, something that seems connected to the city’s underground street racing scene.</p> <p>There’s the orange-haired mechanic at the tuning shop with the FOXGRRL license plate.</p> <p>There’s the strange black cat hanging around my house, and the dreams I’ve been having about a racer girl with cat ears and a tail.</p> <p>There's the girl from high school who had a crush on me. She’s different too, and I can’t figure out why.</p> <p>They all say there’s something special about me. Something important. And it all seems connected to my brother’s mysterious accident.</p> <p>I’m going to sort this out somehow–if I can just keep from getting distracted by all these hot girls chasing after me.</p>";
