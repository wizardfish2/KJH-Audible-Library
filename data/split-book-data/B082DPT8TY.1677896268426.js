A powerful society split into seven psionic orders, each controlling a separate area: minds, flesh, force, truth, machinery, beasts, or the arcane.&nbsp;</p> <p>And suppose you were the only person on earth who could control all seven psychic energies. All you need is a teacher from each order.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Seven orders. Seven amazing powers. Seven beautiful teachers. </i></p> <p>Would you seek these women, unlock your powers, and destroy your enemies?&nbsp;</p> <p>Yes, you would.&nbsp;</p> <p>But you’d better hurry.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because everyone is after you. All seven orders. A shady government bureau. The psionic mafia. And they’ll use any weapon, from guns to psychic attacks to seductive sex, to stop you.&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s time to get tough, grab hold, and unleash the beast!&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Warning: </b><b><i>Power Mage</i></b><b> is the first book in an explosive series containing graphic violence, explicit sex, and a harem of gorgeous women who wreak serious havoc with their minds.
