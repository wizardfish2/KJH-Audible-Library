window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The System is broken.</p> <p>They've come for his daughter.</p> <p>In the middle of efforts to establish a proper school, Eli Hearthsong finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place when Last Stop is flooded by religious refugees, people who lost their gods in the final battle with the Demon Lord. They've heard rumors of a System Prophet, and hope that this unheard of Class can fix their broken skills and abilities.</p> <p>However, the System Prophet is none other than Eli's adopted daughter, Mayari, who is only eight years old. She is still figuring out how to use her Class, and doesn't even know if she can help them. The refugees know that Eli is related to the System Prophet somehow, and some are already choosing violence to get what they want.</p> <p>To make matters worse, the flood of newcomers with broken Classes have triggered a Weather Event, a massive blizzard designed to wipe them out and prevent the spread of their corruption. With Last Stop and the surrounding area buried beneath the snow, can Eli find a solution in time to help everybody out? Or will they all freeze to death instead?</p>";
