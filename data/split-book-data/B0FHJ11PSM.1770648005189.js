A world where a radiant Goddess cures every illness, her Chosen enforce peace, and monsters can be tamed into powerful Familiars. But for Ethan Bishop, a fun-loving doctor ripped from Earth, paradise has a pulse… and it’s not healthy.<br> <br> Beneath the wonder and magic, something is very, very wrong.<br> <br> Fixing things with his traditional training won’t be possible—on Nexum, medical knowledge is considered heresy. His only hope of survival lies in Bonding with magical Familiars. Familiars that grant powers not meant for a doctor, but for an Assassin.<br> <br> To the Church, he's a heretic. To the royal family, he's a weapon. And to the dying world of Nexum, he might be its last chance.<br> <br> But to save it, Ethan will have to become the very thing he’s spent his life fighting against.<br> <br> Doctor. Assassin. Savior. Monster.<br> <br> Which one will he be when the world ends?</p>";
