Nothing ever is easy, he finds out all too quickly.</b></p> <p>After his service to the duchy, the capital city has come to a reluctant acceptance of Morgan Lovecraft. More and more he's finding that people react more to the fear of what he could do rather than what he actually did. All Morgan wanted was to finish his time at the mage's academy but it seems his life as a student there is all but over after fate stepped in his way.</p> <p>His friends and allies are relying on him to not only grow his business empire but his army of undead as well. Working on building his army in unorthodox ways, he stumbles upon several discoveries that lead him down numerous rabbit holes.</p> <p>He still hasn't forgotten his mandate, though. Goblins who overtook an iron mine, dwarves forced to the surface who've started raiding and making war on neighboring hamlets, and of course the syndicate, their blood mages. Many revelations and tribulations, allies, and enemies are waiting for Morgan when he decides to continue playing A Game of The Dead.</p> <p>The Duchy's Necromancer 2 <i>is a fantasy LitRPG progression-based storyline. There are grownups in this book who act like grownups. They drink, they swear, they make bad jokes, and they fall in love. What's not in this book? Harems. Sex scenes. Graphic or otherwise. There are plenty of jokes and innuendo about it, however.</i></p>";
