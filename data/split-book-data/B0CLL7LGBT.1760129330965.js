Once the enemy gets a foothold, we won't have the numbers to stop her. What is her end game, exactly?</p> <p>We're probably outnumbered. We're certainly out skilled.</p> <p>What the enemy doesn't realize is this: as a father of three, I'm always outnumbered. When it comes to shenanigans, I'm often out skilled.</p> <p>My family is my secret weapon.</p>";
