window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>On my eighteenth birthday, I got kicked out of my home, mugged in an alley, and killed a guy with my mind ... then things got weird.</b></p> <p>I expected aging out of the foster care system to be hard. I wasn't expecting it to include finding out I was a Warlock, destined to be hunted by the most powerful Witch Families so they could bind me to a coven of thirteen witches and spend the rest of my life \"harvesting mana\". Add to that a set of magical resonants that made me an even bigger target to some of those Witch Families, some of which would rather kill me than let a rival get me.</p> <p>How's a warlock supposed to stay alive and free? Simple - just go to Witch College, find thirteen witches willing to be bound to you forever in your own coven, and learn enough magic to fend off the most powerful Witch Families in the world.</p>";
