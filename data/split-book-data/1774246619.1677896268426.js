Many young men long to become breeders: humans who are responsible for quelling a catgirlâ€™s lust when they go into heat.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chris Redford was just a normal college student attending San Diego University for his PhD in catgirl physiology and medicine to become a catgirl doctor. When he comes across Silva, an abused catgirl, Chris finds his purpose in life and shifts to accommodate his new responsibilities. Once he learns about what happened to the young catgirl now in his care, he is forced to confront the darker side of humanity.</p> <p><i>Catgirl Doctor contains adult content, themes, and harem situations. It does not pander to prudes.</i></p>";
