window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An arena so deadly only a handful of survivors exist across the span of untold millenniums? What’s that, you say? There’s a secret inside that could be the key to understanding Madra’s mysterious magic.</b></p> <p><b>Bring. It. On!</b></p> <p>Once more, Jiran dives headfirst into the pursuit of knowledge and power in a world stuck on hard mode. He’ll face beasts and challenges beyond his wildest nightmares, new races, and unexpected twists at every turn. Yet great danger is often accompanied by unimaginable opportunity, and if there's one thing Jiran’s good at, it's turning misfortune to his advantage. And this time, that advantage could very well change the empire forever.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mayalyn and Niya are racing toward threats far beyond their means. With his friends and family separated and vulnerable, Jiran will need every skill he's developed to have any chance of saving what matters most.</p> <p>Unbeknownst to them all, ancient and catastrophic forces gather. Their goals are a mystery, and even their true names have been lost to the eons. With one wrong move, life as they know it could cease to exist.</p> <p>But all is not lost. For Madra has never been keen on allowing her prized pets to stagnate. She’s got plans for Jiran, whether he likes it or not. Presented with a choice that will shape his future, Jiran will have only one chance to stack the deck in his favor. And if he’s clever enough, reforge the empire and his gathering allies into a power capable of standing against the coming storm.</p> <p><b>Will Jiran’s new understanding of Madra’s magic give him the edge he needs, or will this be the last book in the series? Why wonder? Pick up book three, </b><b><i>Rebirth of the Density God</i></b><b>, and find out!</b></p>";
