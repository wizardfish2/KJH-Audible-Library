window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A laugh-out-loud, slice-of-life martial-arts fantasy about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. farming????</b></p> <p>Jin Rou wanted to be a cultivator. A man powerful enough to defy the heavens. A master of martial arts. A lord of spiritual power. Unfortunately for him, he died, and now <i>I’m</i> stuck in his body.</p> <p>As Jin, I’m a man of the earth. A wielder of shovels and lord of rice and wheat. And sure, I <i>also</i> had to die and get pulled into another universe to end up here. But guess what? I’m starting to think it was worth it.</p> <p>I’ve somehow managed to get away from it all. Finally free of the bloodshed of cultivator fights, I figure I’ll live in the slow lane from here on out, my only real concern the rain—or lack thereof.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I’ve suddenly got a shady organization looking for me, my cat has gone off to fight in a martial arts tournament, and my chicken has uncovered an ancient crystal containing portents of doom. You know, the <i>usual</i> stuff.</p> <p>I’m not worried though. Sometimes trouble finds you. And while I may not be a master cultivator&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. trouble should know better than to mess with a farmer.</p> <p><b>The third volume of the blockbuster progression-fantasy series—with more than 20 million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
