Take over an entire planet, and take out anyone that gets in your way! </b></p> <p>Against all odds, Val and his men have survived a savage assault initiated by a ruthless foe.

And what better way to accomplish this than by seizing control of the very world spearheading the invasion of Earth!&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Val better act fast, using strategies no one ever sees coming, because the entire corrupt council of Jordian Highlords will stop at nothing to destroy the Terran gamer who dares to walk the Path of Kings!</i></p>";
