window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Garth McFarlane thought he lost his shot at the big leagues. Well, his second chance has arrived.</b></p> <p>Garth had been the favorite for the number-one draft pick in the next season of the USA's top sport. His college career was supposed to end on a high note… but it didn't. Sabotaged in his final game, he found himself shut out of the Dungeon League of America, forced to retire his jersey in shame. With no other options, he leaned on his university degree and became a licensed psychiatrist and therapist.</p> <p>That should have been the end of his dungeon-crawling days. But then, a new dungeon appeared in his city. Before he knew it, an ambitious coach from the upstart X-Treme American Dungeon League was knocking on his door, a catgirl assistant in tow. Their pitch? To make Garth the new captain of the New Arcadia Phoenixes.</p> <p>There's just one awkward sticking point in the contract—his three teammates are all absurdly attractive monster girls in need of therapy, and he's the one providing it.</p>";
