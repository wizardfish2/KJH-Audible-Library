In the third installment of the Scrapyard Ship sci-fi adventure series, Space Vengeance, Jason, his family, and The Lilly's crew face the impending destruction of their internal nano-devices. What's worse, what remains of the Craing fleet, some 1500 warships, is back and headed straight toward the already decimated planets within Allied space. In what looks to be a one-way suicide mission, Jason must leave Nan and Mollie behind on Earth and out of harmâ€™s way.</p> <p>While war rages on 60 light-years from Earth, maniacal space raider Captain Stalls and hundreds of his pirated warships close in on Earth. Stalls knows exactly what he wants: to find and kill Captain Reynolds and take the beautiful Nan Reynolds for his own.</p> <p>Note from the author: If you've made it to this third installment, you already realize this is an ongoing series. With that said, more often than not these books have cliff-hanger endings!</p>";
