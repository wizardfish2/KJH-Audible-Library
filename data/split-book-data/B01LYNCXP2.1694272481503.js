window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cass Clereaux has a few problems. Sure, she just saved her whole town and is now immortal, but immortality sucks. The same spell that made her immortal also takes away her magic. It's kaput. Finito. Gone. Being a FireSoul and finding magical treasure is who she is. Now, she couldn't find her left leg with a map. Not even if a dragon pointed the way. </p> <p>To make matters worse, her concealment charm is malfunctioning. Demons are showing up left and right, trying to bring her head back to the Monster who stalks her. While Cass is on the hunt to recover her magic and learn about her past, the specter of the Monster is getting ever closer to his mysterious end goal. She's prophesied to meet him on the field of battle - but if she doesn't have her magic back by then, she's dead. </p>";
