window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Empire of Giantsrest must fall.</b><br> <br> With an army marching on the liberated city of Halsmet, Nathan and his allies are prepared to fight to the death. Giantsrest may have overwhelming magical might, helmed by the nearly immortal archmage Badud—but Nathan has a few tricks of his own.<br> <br> To win the war that will follow, Nathan must risk it all. With his skills as an antimage and assassin, he will disguise himself behind enemy lines, attacking where Giantsrest least expects it, in the capital—the political heart of their power, where mages jockey for status. But one wrong move would spell failure and place Gemore in the crosshairs. Striking from the shadows, he must defeat his targets and uncover the secrets of the Academy before his time runs out.<br> <br> Even if he fails, Nathan is sure of one thing.<br> <br> <b>His enemies will learn to fear the antimage.</b></p>";
