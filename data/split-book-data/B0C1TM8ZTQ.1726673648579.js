window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sometimes family is there to love you, and sometimes family is there to kill you . . .</p> <p>When a man came into my shop in the Great Marketplace at the Crossroads of the Worlds and tried to kill me, it completely ruined my day. Not only did I have to clean up the blood, but disposing of his body made me late to meet my friends for drinks.</p> <p>A nagging little detail kept bugging me, though. As he died, he said he was hired by my mother's familyâ€”people I hadn't seen for more than a decade. Then I discovered that assassins had made attempts on my brother and sister as well. As much as I didn't want to, I decided I should find out who wanted us dead, and put a stop to it.</p> <p>Talk about stepping out of the pan into the fire . . .</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
