window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Unlikely rancher. Unclaimed land. Unimaginable beauties.</b></p> <p>Blake was searching for simplicity, but fate had other plans. After an unexpected turn of events lands him in the fantastical world of Ylege, he's endowed with extraordinary physical abilities and inherits an unclaimed farmstead at the world's edge. Things seem to be falling into place until he encounters the gorls—beautiful, magical, sentient slimes.</p> <p>As Blake learns the ropes of ranching blerps—the smaller, pearl-producing slimes—from mana gorl Glessal and darkness gorl Slanna, work quickly blurs into pleasure, and romance blossoms. Life is idyllic, but prosperity never goes unnoticed. The covetous Sheriff of the nearby town has his eyes on Blake's ranch, pressuring him to prove its profitability or lose it all.</p> <p>Blake's once undemanding life is now a whirlwind of challenges, from protecting his ranch to defending his blossoming harem from those who would do them harm. With stakes this high, can he hold onto his new life and the gorls who've stolen his heart? Step into a world where ranching meets romance, and where one man's fight for love and livelihood is anything but ordinary.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
