window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Silas is a simple bartender near the Dragon Dungeon, a mythical place that no adventurer has ever returned from...until a beautiful horned stranger walks out of the dungeon and into his bar. To save her from the assassins close on her heels, Silas takes a fatal strike to the stomach...</p> <p>And it doesn't kill him.</p> <p>By some act of fate, Silas has manifested the power to reflect any damage done to him. Now on the run, Silas flees into the seven-level dungeon, where each floor is ruled by a gorgeous dragon goddess who has taken human form. And as it turns out, Silas can steal power from all of them...and maybe steal their hearts, too.</p> <p>But the dungeon has fallen under evil rule, and Silas must venture deeper to save it. With a feisty swordswoman, a spunky lunatic, and a lazy seductress by his side, Silas might not only defeat the goddess at the bottom of the dungeon—he might also become a god of dragons himself.</p>";
