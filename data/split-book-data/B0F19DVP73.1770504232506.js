A past that won’t stay buried.</i></b><br> <br> I’m Amber DeLea—ambitious witch, potion mistress extraordinaire, and daughter to a woman slipping further away each day. My life is a constant battle, whether it’s cursed runes, treacherous coven politics, or dark forces closing in. But nothing haunts me more than my mother’s unravelling mind, and I’m running out of time to find a cure.</p> <p>The last thing I need is Bastion—the deadly griffin assassin who shattered my world—being ordered to protect me. And yet, here he is, my reluctant bodyguard, bound to keep me alive even as old wounds fester between us.</p> <p>Every whispered incantation could be my undoing. Every shadow hides a threat. And every moment with Bastion blurs the line between hatred and something far more dangerous. I’ll do whatever it takes to save my mother—even if it means risking my heart to the one man I swore to despise until my dying breath.</p> <p><b>Devour this witchy series if you love humour, heart, and a strong heroine tangled in a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers fade-to-black romance.</b><br> <br> This box sex collects from The Other Witch Series and includes the whole series:<br> Rune of the Witch, prequel<br> Hex of the Witch, Book 1<br> Coven of the Witch, Book 2<br> Familiar of the Witch, Book 3; and<br> Destiny of the Witch, Book 4.<br> <br> <i>Written in British English.</i></p>";
