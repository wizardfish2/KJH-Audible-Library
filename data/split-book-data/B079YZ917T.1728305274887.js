There's barely time to ponder before a horrific massacre leaves her in charge of her first case with the IEPEU. Under the watchful eye of the organization's top investigator, and with the help of her friends, Carmella must uncover the identity of the supernatural creatures behind the attack and expose the person pulling their strings.</p> <p>If that wasn't enough, her asura power chooses this case to surge to the surface.
