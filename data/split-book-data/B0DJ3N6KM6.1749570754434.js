When I’ve got those spells, building the luxurious subterranean spa at my house will be a breeze.</p> <p>But there are plenty of distractions around to keep me sidetracked: not only am I growing closer to my beautiful girlfriends, but also Surani herself. With this many women around the house, things are really heating up…</p> <p>And when the seemingly quiet house next door starts behaving strangely, it’s up to me to figure out what’s going on behind closed doors.</p>";
