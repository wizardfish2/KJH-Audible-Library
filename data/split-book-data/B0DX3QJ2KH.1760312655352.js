window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Warren is just a guardsman with a haunted past eager for a new castle to defend. All that changes when he's summoned to the edges of the kingdom, where walls protect cities against the diabolical foes of the wildlands. His mission is simple: save the Dragon Farm he just inherited, settle down as a lord, and help his new city thrive. As a soldier who normally lives by the blade, he's out of his element but up to the task... especially since tame dragons seem to like him.</p> <p>The thing is, there's more going on than a simple estate bestowment. Politics stir, assassins run free, and enemies of humanity raise their banners. Worse yet, Warren's past smashes into his present when others uncover his mysterious history. Will a scorned princess be his downfall, or will it be a horde of orcs? Or will a rogue dragon stop his rise to power?</p> <p>Warren doubts it, because he knows he's meant for greatness, and he's not alone. With a clever dragon breeder, a savvy street seller, and a bonded royal dragon of immense power by his side, he might be able to save the world... if his enemies donâ€™t finish him first.</p>";
