window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book 1:</p> <p>When my girlfriend’s dad chased me out of her bedroom that Saturday evening, I never expected to end up transported to a world based on some sort of RPG System. But I guess that’s what happens when you're focused on avoiding the business end of a baseball bat and not paying attention to where you’re running.</p> <p>To make matters worse, I managed to get myself indentured to some sort of dungeon god. That’ll teach me to not read the fine print. The job had some great perks though: an epic class, magic powers, and a smoking hot succubus that couldn’t get enough of me.</p> <p>But there was a catch. The world was on the brink of some kind of oncoming apocalypse that my new boss thought I was somehow qualified to stop.</p> <p>In my old life I probably would have lost my mind, but with my beautiful bondmate and a feisty redhead at my side, anything seemed possible. Even delving into a dungeon potentially full of void demons hell bent on devouring the world… or worse… spiders.</p> <p>Book 2:</p> <p>Being indentured to the God of Dungeons was not on Sebastian’s list of life goals, but when an unfortunate encounter with a semi-truck sent him on a journey across the cosmos to a new world, he did a pretty good job of rolling with the punches.</p> <p>Bonding a beautiful succubus, teaming up with a gorgeous redhead warrior, and saving the world from a demon invasion… All in a day’s work, but as they say: No rest for the wicked.</p> <p>With the threat of another demon incursion looming on the horizon, our intrepid hero has been subcontracted out to the Goddess of Towers to assist her Chosen in determining if the Argent Spire has been compromised.</p> <p>Seems straightforward, right? Not so much. The Argent Spire’s level requirements mean a few pitstops along the way to grind out some levels and gear… and then there’s surviving elven politics.</p> <p>Book 3:</p> <p>After cleansing the Argent Spire and driving out the hellspawn attempting to establish a foothold in Lor, Sebastian was hoping for some time to rest and enjoy the good things in life. Unfortunately, time is in short supply, and there’s no rest for the wicked.</p> <p>It has become abundantly clear that recent events are a part of something much bigger, and as word of fallen Towers and corrupted Dungeons spread, the children of the gods make ready to fight back.</p> <p>In the heart of the Dreadmarsh, the sound of war drums fills the air as Uba’s children are called together for the first time in generations.</p> <p>With his status as a Warlock now known to the humans, Sebastian is offered a place amongst Uba’s children. But first he must earn it, and earn it quickly, for word as come from the east of a city under siege and the people have no time to wait on a single man.</p> <p>Cross a deadly swamp, defeat a demon army, and seal a hole in the very fabric of reality. Just another day in the life of a hero…. Right?</p>";
