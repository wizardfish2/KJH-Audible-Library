And enough food to get through the winter. And probably some more gold.</p> <p>All Montana needs before he can leave Osterstadt are some friends, some building materials, food, and money.&nbsp;</p> <p>But he did promise to retrieve some magic texts from a cemetery for Emmeline. And he really should try to help the lost little boy who keeps following him around. And all the undead in that basement crypt aren't going to re-kill themselves.</p> <p>Maybe Montana's taken on a few too many side quests.</p>";
