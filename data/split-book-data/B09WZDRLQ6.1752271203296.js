For some incredible results just aren't enough!</p> <p>Corruption has insinuated itself deep inside the ranks of agents at FGA. Many believe that tradition is what makes love go 'round. Are they wrong? Will changing the old ways stop love from blossoming in the world?</p> <p>Can Agent Beaufont shatter the beliefs that have kept FGA from evolving?</p> <p>The fate of love depends on it.</p>";
