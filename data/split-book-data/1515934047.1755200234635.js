But show me anything family-related and I'd rather run for the hills. It doesn't even have to be my family.</p> <p>So I have no idea why I thought spending the holidays with Aaron's mom and pop was a good idea.</p> <p>Meeting his famous parents is already terrifying enough, but I've got a bigger problem. Students of his family's renowned mage academy are being attacked on the grounds - and somehow no one has seen a single assailant? Unexplained tracks litter the nearby woods, rumors of forbidden alchemy are circulating the campus...and Ezra has been acting strangely since we arrived.</p> <p>Something deadly is brewing in the shadow of Sinclair Academy, and the longer we take to uncover it, the more dangerous it becomes. But no matter the risk, we'll protect the students.</p> <p>And Aaron's parents too, I suppose. If we have to.</p> <p>Make sure to check out the companion series, The Guild Codex: Demonized, available now, and The Guild Codex: Warped, coauthored by Rob Jacobsen.</p>";
