Sure, that was how Murmur always imagined fully immersive VR.</p> <p>With the getashi’s growing in influence, Fable's race against the clock is thrown into disarray as the dungeons begin to make their own rules. As a last resort, Fable teams up with Spiral and Exodus to speed things up. But with tensions growing between the groups, it’s a matter of when and not if they’ll be betrayed. Murmur’s team begins to fray as her abilities branch out and start to those around her.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Laria and Shayla run out of ways to hide Wren’s involvement in the more frequent glitches occurring in-game. It’s all they can do to keep the system stable while James nips at their heels.</p> <p>Somnia’s awareness expands in unexpected ways. The threats within and without close in, but the true danger may just be in Murmur’s mind.</p>";
