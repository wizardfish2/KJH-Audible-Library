window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's the year 2277. For 50 years, Earth has received mysterious data transmissions from random locations in deep space. The streams include advanced technology, allowing humans to achieve faster-than-light travel virtually overnight. As we prepare to take our first tentative steps into interstellar space, we know almost nothing about our alien benefactors, and their motivations remain unexplained. </p> <p>While completing their shakedown cruise, Captain Tom Prescott and the crew of the first Terran Fleet Command starship, TFS <i>Ingenuity</i>, stumble into a first contact situation. They learn that Earth is not the first civilization granted access to the stars before their time - and how this Faustian gift has inevitably led to centuries of interstellar war. Humanity's existence hangs in the balance as a powerful alliance assembles a preemptive military strike, believing it to be their only option to protect themselves...from us. Prescott and his small, initially unarmed starship must serve as our only line of defense. <i>Ingenuity</i> is our only hope. </p>";
