Unfortunately, the skills he honed to keep the peace aren't much use in the cutthroat world of city politics, and a recent civil ruling is forcing the integration of the once exclusively human NHIC!</p> <p>Velise is a beautiful arachne noble sent to the human-ruled city of Daytau as part of a diplomatic boondoggle to prove her political skills to her matriarch. A chance encounter with Andrew leaves her wanting to know more, and the integration gives her an opportunity both to sate her curiosity and advance her ambitions.</p> <p>Yet the barroom brawl Andrew diffused for her sake was no accident, and city hall would love nothing more than to end his career. Forced by circumstance both to protect and rely on a monster, Andrew comes to an uncomfortable realization.</p> <p>Velise might just be everything he ever wanted in a woman....&nbsp;</p>";
