Why, she gathers up her friends, her kitties, and her newfound powers as a hybrid core and gets to work.</b></p> <p>With only 199 days to deal with the lich, Florence must take the dungeon she calls a home on the road and eliminate the source of the lich’s power: infected dungeon cores.</p> <p>Whether these infected cores will become enemies or allies remains to be seen, but they aren’t the only threat Florence and her friends will face. Others will seek to use Florence’s unique nature for their own gain or destroy her for what she has become. A powerful lich, the adventurers guild, and even a grieving king will stand in her way, but Florence has friends of her own and the best thing in the entire world at her side… her kitties.</p> <p>Join Florence in the epic conclusion to the Cat Core series.</p>";
