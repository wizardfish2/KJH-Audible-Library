window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A young artist implanted with a sophisticated AI becomes humanity's champion on another world in this thrilling science-fiction fantasy-adventure series.</b></p> <p>The son of a billionaire tech entrepreneur, Logan Specter spends his time—and his family's wealth—on artistic and altruistic pursuits. His indulgences have produced a pile of paintings and a string of failed charities. A rebel without a cause who defies his father's corporatist lifestyle while benefiting from the privileges it affords him, Logan lacks true ambition, unable to commit himself to his own potential. The only things in his life giving him any direction are his girlfriend, Freya, and her unconditional love.</p> <p>Malcolm Specter didn't become the wealthiest man in the world by waiting for inspiration. He built MindTech as the ultimate megacorporation, always creating innovative products with an eye to the future. But when a giant countdown timer appears in the sky forecasting the end of the world, he can no longer wait for his son to grow up. Against Logan's will, Malcolm implants an AI into the young Specter's brain to enhance his intelligence, altering him into the next generation of humanity, a new breed designed to survive the apocalypse.</p> <p>When a rift suddenly opens above Earth's skies, Logan, Malcolm, and a host of others are transported to another realm full of mythical creatures and monsters borne of nightmares. Guided by the sentient computer in his mind, Logan discovers how to tap into this world's magical Numa crystals and use their power to protect and defend his people. But even as he attempts to embrace his destiny as a warrior and leader, dark forces rise to oppose him, casting a shadow that threatens to consume all life . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 750,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
