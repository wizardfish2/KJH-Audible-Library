But when a back-alley brawl leaves me marked with a bizarre Celtic crest on my back, I become a beacon for all things whacked and weird.</p> <p>So I do what any stubborn red-headed lass would—I ignore all advice and fly to the Emerald Isle to get answers.</p> <p>A Sacred Grove: Since I totally ignored Da's warning and flew to Ireland to embrace our super-secret heritage, I've seen the world in a different light—a mythical and magical light.</p> <p>From quests heaped on me from ancestors to trampy witches and misogynistic hobgoblins, I'm pretty much screwed from the get-go.</p> <p>A Family Oath: Since being marked as the heir apparent I've been stabbed, kidnapped, black-listed, tortured, targeted, and accused of being the cause of pretty much every magical mishap that's hit the streets of Toronto.</p> <p>And who the hell is stupid enough to think resurrecting the evil Morgan le Fey is a good idea? With evil brewing, enemies running rampant, and The Lakeshore Guild of Empowered Ones ineffective at policing its members, my family and cool new friends set out to right the wrongs of our world.</p>";
