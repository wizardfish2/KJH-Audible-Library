And in his spare time, he must conduct the biggest heist in the history of the world, search for the crime syndicate that is secretly running the planet, deal with a villain that had taken over the White House, save astronauts trapped on the wrecked International Space Station, and destroy an army of terrorists with a bit of orbital bombardment.
