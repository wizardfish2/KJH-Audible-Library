He can turn into a churro.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>In a world where one percent of the population has powers, he's quite below average; many would say he's completely useless. And they have. At length. <i>For years.</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite his deep-seated desire to be a hero, his ability isn't glamorous and can't be used to fight crime, so he and a small cadre of similarly useless supers are relegated to Omega Team and told explicitly that all they will ever need to do is sit there and look pretty.&nbsp;</p> <p>And while waiting to be called up to the big leagues, they might as well get laid, right?&nbsp;</p> <p>Dangerous secrets will send the Omegas on an adventure none of them could have anticipated.&nbsp;</p> <p>Can they step up to the plate and become the heroes they were meant to be?&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Warning: This book contains explicit content and ridiculous situations that are suitable only for adults. But not, like, adult-y adults. More like teenagers who have adult bodies. (It's lowbrow, is what I'm saying.) Listener discretion strongly advised. 18+ only.</b></p>";
