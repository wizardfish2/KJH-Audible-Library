But the consequences of falling from a rock wall are usually broken bones and bruises . . . not waking up in the body of a dragon. So when a young bouldering instructor finds herself suddenly transported to a strange new world—and into a powerful black-scaled frame— she must rethink all the rules as well as her own expectations in order to survive.</p> <p>Adopting the name Draka, the newly minted dragoness begins to explore the forests, mountains, and villages surrounding the city of Karakan. To survive and thrive, she must learn to spread her wings, discover the joys of growing her hoard, and figure out how to handle the seductively draconic voice encouraging her to find violent means to any ends.</p> <p>But most importantly, Draka will need to overcome her intimidating shape to form alliances with the human adventurers she meets. Because sometimes even dragons need a little help from their friends.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit fantasy adventure series—with more than a million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
