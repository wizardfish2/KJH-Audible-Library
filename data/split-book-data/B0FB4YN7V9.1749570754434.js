window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The day Ben died was the best day of his life. And it turns out being dead is even better!</p> <p>When Benjamin Nickels discovers he's the proud new owner of a derelict hobby farm, inherited from a crazy uncle he's never met, he's too excited to question his good fortune. He tells off his boss, quits his job, and heads out of town to Lucky Nickel Acres.</p> <p>While inspecting the property, an accident sends Ben flying headfirst into an old well and tumbling into a very different new world. Bad luck? Not likely. He thinks he's died and gone to heaven!</p> <p>Better yet, Ben is intrigued to find his afterlife is governed by a magical system that works a lot like his favorite farming simulator video game--with a very sexy difference.</p> <p>Planting crops and raising chickens is one thing. But the World of Faerowilde also has female demi-beasts that need to be tamed and bred, and Ben finds he's just the man for the job.</p> <p>Along with his trusty handbook Demi-Beast Husbandry for Fun and Profit, Ben sets out to make Lucky Nickel Acres the best damned farm in Faerowilde.</p> <p>Plowing fertile fields, sowing his seed, and reaping the rewards of his hard work is a little piece of heaven that Ben is more than happy to have died for.</p>";
