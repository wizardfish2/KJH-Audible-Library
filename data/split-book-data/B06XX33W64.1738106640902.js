window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A whole new series from the world of the Echo Trilogy. </p> <p>Three years ago, the gods abandoned us. We've been alone ever since. </p> <p>Kat Dubois is immortal, and she's retired. She's long since hung up her sword and left assassinating immortals to someone else...anyone else. She's now a hard drinking, sass-flinging Seattle tattoo artist with the innate ability to read people's fortunes using her charmed deck of tarot cards. Her days of bloodshed are over, and she has nothing but time - an eternity, in fact - to hide from her past. </p> <p>Until someone from her past shows up on her doorstep with news that her beloved older brother and mentor, Dominic, has gone missing. Kat may be the only person with the right skills - and access to the right magic - to track him down. She must confront her past if she's to have any chance of finding and saving her brother. She must fight her demons. She must embrace the power within her. </p> <p>She must become the Ink Witch. </p>";
