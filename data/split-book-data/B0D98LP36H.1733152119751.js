window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hadjar has seen everything that the Mortal Realm of the Nameless World has to offer. Beloved son, disgraced prince, brother, loyal friend, brave warrior, illustrious commander, murderer, traitor, devoted husband, monster . . . All these roles converge in Hadjar Darkhan, the Mad General. He has left behind songs and tales of courage and honor that have become the lament of the thousands who've met their end at his blade, their blood drenching the fields and valleys of the mortal regions. And he did it all so he could keep going, so his journey wouldn't end before its time.</p> <p>Hadjar now stands at the threshold of the Land of the Immortals, a legendary realm of epics. Here, he awaits his penultimate battle. What lies ahead? The path to the Seventh Heaven. And, for better or worse, all that this journey will both create and end. In the Nameless World, some things can be too horrid for anyone to dare and try to comprehend. But if anyone believes that this will slow the General's stride or halt his sword, then . . . As has always been the case, neither demons nor gods, neither heroes nor villains, neither Time nor Fate can break the indomitable will of Hadjar Darkhan.</p>";
