Corin has other plans: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Meet Anabelle Farren, the eccentric owner of Farren Labs, and learn about artificial attunements.</li> <li>Seek out Warren Constantine, a previous Arbiter, for training and a potential alliance.</li> <li>Find the visage Ferras herself to seek a cure for Sera's condition.</li> </ul> <p>Of course, Corin is Corin, and there's absolutely no chance he's going to be able to stick to a list. Even if he miraculously developed a sense of focus, he isn't the only one with plans.... </p> <p>The Blackstone Bandit. Everyone's favorite mysterious book entity. The aforementioned Farren.
