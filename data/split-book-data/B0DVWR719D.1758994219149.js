Work on my subterranean spa is complete, the sun is shining, and a new neighbor is due to move in next door any day now.</b></p> <p>I’ve got plenty of time to spend with the beautiful women I live with, too: Sophie and Victoria are helping me to solve a few magical mishaps in the area, while Surani and Eva are continuing to combine their natural magic.
