window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Marc is all too aware that the end of the acclimatization year the System has provided to Earth is quickly drawing to a close and that others will be allowed onto the planet to start claiming areas shortly. Zeus has promised that his series of quests will get Marc, at least, to the maximum level reachable in that first year, but Marc is nervous that it isn't going to happen.</p> <p>With the transformation of his Safe Zone network into a Kingdom, Marc finds more responsibilities, Fortunately for him, even the help files on the Kingdom recommend delegating authority and, as a result, Sean finds himself with more work than ever. The transformation to a Kingdom also gives Marc some new options. Now he can convert dungeons he completes into Training Dungeons, designed to be more survivable, although giving fewer benefits in the process of completing them. He can also create Training Dungeons from dungeon cores that he has claimed, giving him lots of options to build a strong defensive force for the Kingdom.</p> <p>With a little bit of abuse of the System's rules, Marc's Kingdom makes it into the Space Age, allowing them to accept Zeus' final quest. A visit to a secret base on the moon gives them the final thing needed for Zeus and Hera to launch their attack on the System in their endeavor to replace it with their own 'kinder, gentler' version.</p>";
