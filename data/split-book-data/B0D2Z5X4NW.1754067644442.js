Fingers crossed!</p> <p>Thirty years after a failed invasion of the goblin home world, power technician Kevin wakes up in a wrecked Imperial Marine dropship with no clue how he got there. Worse, the planet has been devastated by a biological weapon, and the few survivors are bloodthirsty mutants.</p> <p>Kevin’s skills could get the ship’s power plant working and help out a community of adorable goblin girls. But–er–there’s a small complication. They’d rather murder him for what the Empire did to their planet.</p> <p>All is not as it seems, however, for the cause of the war is tied up in the strange fascination the goblin girls have with human men. Can Kevin find the parts he needs to get the reactor fixed? Will the goblin girls take him into their community or string him up like a piñata? And do hot, angry goblins even make good mates?</p> <p>Goblin Apocalypse is a short and occasionally silly slice-of-life novel featuring cute goblins, dangerous mutants, and what is probably too much techie stuff for a book like this.</p>";
