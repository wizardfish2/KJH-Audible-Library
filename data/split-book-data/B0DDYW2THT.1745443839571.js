window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the government thinks they have a lead on an inexpensive energy source, they throw together a research project for it, disregarding some unfortunate occurrences with similar research previously. The theory is that they can create a wormhole that will constantly allow energy through, then they'll convert the energy into electricity and feed it into the grid. Maxwell Carter works a maintenance job at a government research facility.</p> <p>The research lab he works at has an accident, more energy coming through the wormhole than anticipated, enough to completely rupture the shields that were supposed to contain it until they finished determining how to convert the energy into electricity. Previously harmless animals are changed to nightmare threats and people are dying, seemingly due to incidents related directly to their interests.</p> <p>Max and his friend Ron make it out of the facility alive, although the rest of the people in the facility aren't so lucky. The strangeness that was surrounding the labs seems to be expanding, even reaching his home within a day or two. Now strange screens, reminiscent of some of the online games he's played, are appearing in his vision, and apparently Prometheus, the AI running on the supercomputer from the research lab, is the one in charge of it all and is dedicated to spreading this new energy worldwide.</p>";
