window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The complete series in a single offering! This battle shall reach its inevitable conclusion -- and the final triumph will belong to Doctor Undying!</p> <p>I changed the face of the world, creating a paradise for superhumans. All it took was throwing a fight and spending forty years in jail. That was a small price to pay as an immortal. But now that I’m out on parole, I fully intend on enjoying the world I created.</p> <p>When the parole board stuck me in a scared straight mentorship program, I decided to turn the tables against them. I would teach the two beautiful, badass women in my care not to be repentant heroes or good citizens, but instead, I would help them become true supervillains. Under my tutelage, I would see them rise to become world-shaking terrors!</p> <p>Of course, no plans go off without a hitch. Some fool decided to steal my archive of mad doomsday weapons and turn them against me. But no matter! With my villainesses beside me, I will strike horrible vengeance upon them.</p> <p>Let the world tremble, for Doctor Undying has returned!</p>";
