window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Alexander Price has survived gorgons, basilisks, and his own family - no small feat considering that his family includes two telepaths, a reanimated corpse, and a colony of talking, pantheistic mice. Still, he's starting to feel like he's got the hang of things - at least until his girlfriend, Shelby Tanner, shows up asking pointed questions about werewolves and the state of his passport. From there it's just a hop, a skip, and a jump to Australia, a continent filled with new challenges, new dangers, and yes, rival cryptozoologists who don't like their \"visiting expert\" very much. </p> <p>Australia is a cryptozoologist's dream, filled with unique species and unique challenges. Unfortunately it's also filled with Shelby's family, who aren't delighted by the length of her stay in America. And then there are the werewolves to consider: infected killing machines who would like nothing more than to claim the continent as their own. The continent which currently includes Alex. </p> <p>Survival is hard enough when you're on familiar ground. Alex Price is very far from home, but there's one thing he knows for sure: he's not going down without a fight. </p>";
