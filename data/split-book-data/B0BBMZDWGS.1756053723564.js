To make matters worse, the other gods may be taking a hand in things now.

His team will bring armies to fight for him, even as he learns what it truly means to be a god. It isn't the end step that many seem to think it is, but rather just another rung on ladder of cultivation.</p> <p>Once those secrets are unlocked he finds out that death may only be the beginning.</p> <p>This book contains detailed adult activities and is intended for mature listeners. </p>";
