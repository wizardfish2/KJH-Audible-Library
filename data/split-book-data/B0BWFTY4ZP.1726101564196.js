Within the burning rubble, a young woman found a baby, the sole survivor of the attack, and decided to take it with her and raise it as her own. As she was leaving with the little child in her hands, two falling stars lit up the night sky, and she named the boy Asterios.</p> <p>Years passed, and the boy grew up in a caring and warm home, developing a passion for all magical beasts, choosing the path of a Summoner as his way of life.

Wait...doesn't it look like...<i>a girl</i>? Are those beast ears and tail?</p> <p><b><i>Experience the bundle of the first three volumes from the series Rise of the Weakest Summoner in one go!
