window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Four friends set out to fix their crumbling magical world in the exciting fantasy-adventure sequel to </b><b><i>The Fabric of Reality</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>There's a disturbance in the Prime Kingdoms. The system that everyone depends on is generating errors. The gods are in danger. Magic itself is fluctuating and becoming less reliable. Meanwhile, four adventurers seem to be the only ones to realize the night sky shouldn't be empty . . .</p> <p>Outcasts all, this foursome has become a family. They are Sev, a healer with a penchant for sacrificing too much; Misa, a half-orc woman never afraid of a fight; Vex, a lizardkin wizard grappling with his feelings for one of his teammates; and Derivan, a sentient suit of armor who's learning to deal with, well, feelings in general. Together, they are on a diplomatic mission for their guild, traveling to the kingdom of Elyra to provide emergency relief as magic continues to malfunction and crops fail to grow.</p> <p>But while this team can hold their own in battle against bandits or simple dungeon monsters, the complex mysteries their realm continues to throw at them are another matter. For now, all they can do is try to make the world a better place. And that's exactly what they plan to do—until they arrive in the town of Fendal and everything there seems just a little <i>too</i> perfect . . .</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with almost two million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
