He's had many.<br> <br> Changing names is necessary when you possess a power that every lawman and outlaw would kill to obtain. To survive, you keep your head down, kill when you must, and never stay in one place too long. It's a life governed by rules and hard lessons, drilled into him from a young age after his parents were murdered because of his gift.<br> <br> Since then, the trail of bodies has only grown longer.<br> <br> But all that is about to change. After years of chasing two-bit bounties, honing his skills, and growing his core, he's finally caught the scent of the man he's been searching for the first of four bodies that will end this carnage once and for all.<br> <br> Now, it's time to put his cursed powers to use.<br> <br> It's time for revenge.</p>";
