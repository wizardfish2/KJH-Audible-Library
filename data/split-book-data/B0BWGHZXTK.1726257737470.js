And every single one of them wants to see Michael dead.</p> <p>When betrayal causes the death of someone close to him, he decides that diplomacy is far overrated. And sometimes crossing the line isn't enough; sometimes you need to demolish it to do what is right. So, set the Geneva Conventions on fire and punish the guilty, because sometimes, mercy is a luxury you cannot afford.</p> <p>If pain and death are the only things his enemies know, then he will speak their language fluently.</p> <p>Can they finish and launch the spaceship into orbit before time runs out? And what did the ancient aliens hide underneath the Pacific Ocean?</p>";
