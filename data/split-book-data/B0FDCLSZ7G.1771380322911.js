A master of martial arts. A lord of spiritual power. Unfortunately for him, he died, and now <i>I'm</i> stuck in his body.</p> <p>But I think he'd like how things are turning out.</p> <p>So much happened last year! The battle at the Dueling Peaks, the revelation at the Azure Hills, and the calamity that damaged them. But most important? I became a father. It's hard and stressful at times, but I've got an entire family for support. And yes, some of its members have feathers or fur. (Big D is <i>very</i> good at lullabies.)</p> <p>Anyway, spring awaits, and I find myself optimistic. I wish for a long, peaceful year for everyone. Even Gramps, the cultivator who took Rou in after his parents died. He cared enough to write me a letter so I hope my return message finds him well.</p> <p>Though I'm <i>probably</i> never going to see him again. After all, Rou was just a random kid he picked up on a whim. He can't be <i>that</i> interested in me . . . Right?</p> <p><b>The fifth volume of the blockbuster progression-fantasy series—with more than 20 million views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
