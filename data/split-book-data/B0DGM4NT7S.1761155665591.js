I’m not sure what we’ll find there, but I expect my uninvited frequent visitor will make an appearance.</p> <p>You’d think that having a smoking hot catgirl following you around would be a good thing, but it’s not in this case. She’s an assassin, and she’s tried to kill me several times already. Truly a bad kitty.</p> <p>With my knockout moonwisp Brin, my delectable goblin crafter Tyra, and my indescribably beautiful elf swordmaster Sariel, we’ll search this new land for leads on where to find the demigod Aeyr.</p> <p>So I can put an end to him once and for all.</p> <p>Of course, there are dangers other than misbehaving felines and super-powerful mages. We’ll have to take care of those, too. It's part of the job for a reluctant hero.</p> <p>While we’re at it, maybe we’ll get lucky and find a way to make the feral catgirl purr. It’d be a shame to have to put her down. This new world I’m in can use all the catgirls it can get. Any world can, really.</p> <p>They say black cats are bad luck. I’m hoping to turn that superstition on its head. If I can survive the claws.</p>";
