Unlike Logan, this so-called king rules with fear, not loyalty, and he’s not leaving without a fight.</p> <p>As war brews on two fronts, Logan has to step up his game. The Holy Knights are packing anti-magic EMPs, his rival is staking his claim on the East Coast, and his own witches are busy bickering about snacks and...stuff that should not be mentioned in a blurb. It’s a mess—but Logan is nothing if not resourceful.</p> <p>With his magical ladies backing him, a few dangerous artifacts up his sleeve, and a knack for turning enemies into allies, Logan will prove why the Inevitable Coven King isn’t just a title—it’s a fact.</p> <p>Whether it’s politics, prophecy, or pillow fights, Logan plays to win.</p>";
