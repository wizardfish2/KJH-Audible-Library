One cold and forgotten cup of coffee at a time.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was an environment that made some sense to him. At least in comparison to civilian life where almost nothing did. On top of that, it gave him a chance to hide what he was from the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>An apex predator that made the entirety of the paranormal world fear him.
