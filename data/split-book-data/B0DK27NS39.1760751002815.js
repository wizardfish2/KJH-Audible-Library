Clarke and the lovely ladies of Broken Fang have won their first victory against the vampires who secretly rule the world. But their fight is far from over. To defeat the vampires once and for all, they’ll need to rally powerful allies to their cause.

The coven agrees and assigns him to Ixia Grey, a young witch and aspiring esports player.
