window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An existence spent being forced to kill others to satiate a monster. </p> <p>Where the only thing to look forward to was the blessed, if brief, period of time between paying that bribe. </p> <p>Except that very same monster is and isn’t Rene. </p> <p>It just happened to live inside his own mind and force him to do what it wanted. Rather than being an actual monster. </p> <p>That was Rene’s entire life until a fateful day changed that. Where he died in a mission gone wrong. </p> <p>When he met the Watcher in the afterlife, and took on a new life. A life of idyllic bliss that involved having a family. </p> <p>Until he was kidnapped and taken to a new city. A city where Rene broke free, set down roots, opened a business, an orphanage, an underground gang, and began taking over. </p> <p>Rene has become the Hood, the Mask, and young Anatolis all in one. </p> <p>Where he continues to take more power with the Anatolis bankroll, his blade, or someone else’s blood. </p> <p>Except as he gains more power, he becomes more of a target. </p> <p>With every day, more people are targeting one of his lives and what they can take from him. </p> <p>The city is about to be pitched head-first into the front lines of more than one fight to the death. </p> <p>It has no idea, and it’s one true defender is a serial-killer turned hitman who became a bounty-hunting money-lender that moonlights as a gang leader. </p> <p>All before the month is over. </p> <p><b>Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show. Listen at your own risk.</b></p>";
