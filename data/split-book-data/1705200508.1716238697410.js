A dying tyrant.</b></p> <p>Finn Harris was declared the Mage Guild's champion.</p> <p>However, that was only the beginning of the Emir's competition. The next stage will send Finn and his companions deep into the desert north of Lahab in search of a long-lost relic. The magical artifact is said to be held within the Abyss.</p> <p>Except, this time, he's not just facing novice mages. Everyone in the region seems to be arrayed against him, god and man alike.
