Then I had one final vision, and I saw the truth. The Abhorrent, the eldritch, evil force behind Pestilence, was undefeated and still intent on devouring the light of everything good.</p> <p>I saw that I would fail, everyone I loved would die, and without us, the worlds would crumble, even the gods unable to stand against the Abhorrent.</p> <p>This left me with one question: How does one go about changing the future? </p> <p>They tell me the Abhorrent is immortal. </p> <p>As far as I’m concerned, that’s just a slight inconvenience. </p> <p><i>Gods of Ash and Amber</i> is the fourth and final book in a dark and deliciously violent adventure series that combines science fiction, fantasy, and game elements. You'll love Gods of Ash and Amber because of the electrifying action, flawed characters, and kick-ass heroine. </p> <p><b>Buy </b><b><i>Gods of Ash and Amber</i></b><b> now to finish Eve's story.</b></p>";
