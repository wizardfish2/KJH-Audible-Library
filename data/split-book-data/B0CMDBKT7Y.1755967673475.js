This time, I'm not working aloneâ€”I've got to form and lead a team of warlocks to take on a series of increasingly dangerous challenges. If I pull it off, a trove of rewards is mine.</p> <p>Angry Alpha peers getting in my way aren't the only thing I need to worry about. There's also the problem of the legendary being clinging to my soul, the cultists trying to hunt me down, and the legacy of an ancient battle that poses a threat not just to the Academy but the whole planet.</p> <p>All of it points to a deeper, darker plot by a powerful villain getting ready to step out of the shadows.</p>";
