Just a few short days after my friends and I defeated Roman, the System gleefully informed us about a hidden world event. We have no idea when it'll strike, nor do we know when the two alien species brought to our corner of Gaea will appear. Even worse, Boris and Miki have vanished. With the two brutal criminal bosses lurking in the wings, no human is safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, I noticed something strange about Gaea. The world seems incomplete and hazy around the edges. Something big is happening behind the scenes, but we've only barely scratched the surface.</p> <p><b><i>Tower Apocalypse is a LitRPG perfect for fans of isekai, a steadily growing MC, whacky summons, tower climbing, civilization/base building, loot, grinding, and apocalyptic worlds with PvP, PvE, sieges, and boss hunting.</i></b></p>";
