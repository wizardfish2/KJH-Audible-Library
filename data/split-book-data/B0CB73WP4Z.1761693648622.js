window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A lot has changed for Kirk Jensen.</b></p> <p>He wasn't the slightly fat, fast-food-slinging new guy anymore. His whole existence changed that night he was attacked by a bear and joined the ranks of Kodiak Island's shifter community. He even managed to land his dream job on the island's police force. But Kirk is so much more than just another werewolf shifter. He's an alpha bear, the most powerful shifter on the island, and wanted by both of the dueling packs as an ally to settle their centuries-long feud.</p> <p>In his first week as a shifter, he was nearly killed and had to track down those responsible for attacking both packs. Attacks that would have revealed the existence of shifters to the human world. He succeeded, managed to stop a war between the packs, and earned the respect of everyone around him. Not a bad first week for a rookie.</p> <p>Too bad that within a few hours of being released from the hospital, someone tried to kill himâ€”again. The fragile peace he was able to forge between the packs is already fraying, and in all the chaos, other supernatural players are coming out of the shadows. If that wasn't enough, the pair of werewolf women vying for his attention are getting feisty, and others are circling. It looks like it will take nothing less than an alpha bear to keep the island safe, and Kirk is just the shifter for the job.</p> <p><i>Intended for mature listeners.</i></p>";
