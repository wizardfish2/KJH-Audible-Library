He stumbles upon a plot to use rogue Dungeons to reignite the Demon Wars between monsterkind and the core races of Almora.</p> <p>Few would expect the lowliest of all monsters to be the savior of both mankind and monsterkind. After all, how could one shrub stop a plot decades in the making? You could ask the serpentii the same thingâ€”if there were any left.</p>";
