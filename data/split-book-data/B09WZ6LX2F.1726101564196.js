Not the worst, not the best, and definitely not the thinnest. Even so, he didn't deserve that heart attack! He <i>really </i>didn't deserve being reborn into a magic-filled, dog-eat-dog world as a dragon.</p> <p>To be fair, it’s nice to be at the top of the food chain. Now Carl just needs to learn how magic works, which monsters are safe to eat, and why his hoard is so <i>important</i> to him. Dealing with everything changing is hard enough, but he has enemy dragons incoming, hostile environments, and foes constantly trying to get bragging rights by taking down a dragon.</p> <p>At the end of the day, Carl needs to learn how to build a life worth living in a world where might makes right.</p>";
