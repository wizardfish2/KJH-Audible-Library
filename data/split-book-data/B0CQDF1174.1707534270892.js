The castle lay in ruins around them, its repair a daunting task for even the most industrious little vacuum. Fortunately, cleaning is Spot's specialty.</p> <p>But little do they know that their actions have far-reaching consequences. A new threat has begun to rise in the countryside—an undead plague that threatens to scour the land of any human life.</p> <p>To fight against them, Spot will need to do more than ever before. He will have to fight zombies, defend his new home from invaders, and overcome his greatest foe yet—the dreaded stairs. And also clean, of course.</p> <p>But as they turn the castle into a beacon of order and cleanliness, they'll soon find others flocking toward their banner of hope. People who see Spot as more than just a vacuum …</p> <p>Follow this wholesome vacuum on his quest to power in <i>All the Dust that Falls</i>, a hilarious new Isekai LitRPG that will make you question what it means to be a hero.
