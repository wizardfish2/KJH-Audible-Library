window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When I went to the Caribbean for my friend's bachelor party, I wanted to experience white sand beaches, crystal blue waters, and gorgeous women. I didn't want to almost get assassinated.</p> <p>On the plus side, a beautiful mermaid saved me and magically healed my wounds. She’s got more scales than I pictured the beach babes having, but she's just as drop-dead gorgeous as I pictured them being.<br> The only hiccup is that I’m apparently the only one who can save her world. That's a tall order for a normal guy, so it helps when she reveals I have the mystic ability to bend the elements of water and lightning to my will.</p> <p>This isn’t the kind of holiday weekend I expected, but if I can learn to master my powers then I’ll become the infamous storm mage, one of the most powerful men in the world.</p> <p>Time to get soaked up and powered on!</p>";
