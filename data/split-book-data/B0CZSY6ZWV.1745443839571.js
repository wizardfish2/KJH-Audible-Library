window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Send living shadows to drag me to another world? They better be ready for a fight!</b></p> <p>I’ve always been a scrapper, so when I was snatched from my world by shadow creatures and hauled to another one, I did as I’d always done. I fought. But I still didn’t know anything about where I was.</p> <p>My luck was in, because I quickly had the good fortune of meeting a sexy prophetess and a gorgeous, blue-skinned, redheaded mage who said she was something called a moonwisp. Yeah, magic was a thing.</p> <p>The problem with that? Everyone in the world had some. Magic, that is. Everyone but me. I guess that’s what I get for coming from a non-magic world.</p> <p>But I’m not the complaining type. I pulled up my big boy pants and started the search for my best friend, Lucas, who had also been abducted. I have to admit, I was more than a little pissed off at the shadow monsters. Enough that I planned on tearing apart every one of them I came across.</p> <p>Funny thing: as I searched, I found people mistaking me for some long-dead hero. I didn’t know anything about that, but I did know one thing. Regardless of what else happened, I was going to find my friend. With my newly acquired companions by my side, I would burn this new world down if that’s what it took to find Lucas.</p> <p>I don’t know if shadows can be terrified, but I sure aim to find out.</p>";
