Repeat.</p> <p>Jade was born wrong, as a magicless half-beastkin in a world ruled by power.</p> <p>After a failed elven ritual traps her in a monster-filled dungeon, restraint stops mattering. She wakes up with scales, wings, and a body that grows stronger with every kill. The hunt feels good. Almost too good.</p> <p>The only catch is that she’s becoming a dragon, in mind and body.</p> <p>To escape, Jade must climb the dungeon’s food chain, indulging the instincts she spent her life suppressing, or die as prey. After all, humanity is optional. Survival isn’t.</p>";
