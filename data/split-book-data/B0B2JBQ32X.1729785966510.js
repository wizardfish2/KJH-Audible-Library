window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A dragon without a hoard</i></p> <p>Dragon shifter Kezari gave up everything to stop the poison she’d sensed on Earth. Though welcomed by the Moranaian elves, she struggles to find her place in a land with different customs and expectations. Her situation only gets worse after she’s assigned to deliver healing potions with the annoying mind healer Tynan. How is she supposed to work with a man when she can’t decide whether to push him away or kiss him?</p> <p><i>A mind healer on the brink</i></p> <p>After a mishap in his youth, Tynan trained hard to hone his gifts of mind healing and empathy, but working at Braelyn is his greatest challenge. Between traumas and mystery plagues, his temporary assignment stretches from days to weeks. But his biggest problem? Kezari, the dragon shifter he’s certain is his soulbonded. Her nearness strains his control over his empathy—and he knows far too well that losing his grip on his gift means catastrophe.</p> <p><i>A struggle between worlds</i></p> <p>Kezari and Tynan must learn to work together quickly. Trouble is stirring with the dragons, and when a meeting with the ancient dragon Caeregas reveals the extent of the problem, Kezari feels honor bound to solve it. Too bad working with the mind healer might be her only chance at victory.</p>";
