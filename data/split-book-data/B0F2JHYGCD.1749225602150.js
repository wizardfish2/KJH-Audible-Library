To do so, he has to leave his dragon farm behind enemy lines, and go on a journey with a seductive blood mage and a suspicious foreign noblewoman. Together, they head to the island kingdom of Kiloba—where his greatest enemy is lying in wait.</p> <p></p> <p>On the way, Warren will have to unlock new powers in his dragons, and in himself. He’ll have to overcome a mystery force that’s weakening his bond to the Demon Ignace and unearth ancient boons beyond his wildest imaginings. While new enemies close in and evil dragons loom, Warren must meet every challenge and grow stronger for it.</p> <p></p> <p>And once Warren gathers the power needed to do the unthinkable, he can rise up against the king of Parshil himself.</p>";
