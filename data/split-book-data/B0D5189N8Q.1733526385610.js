The Star Ravagers would be redeemed, and the Republic and the Saints would pay for the betrayal.</p> <p>My path has carried me across the stars, joined by a beautiful AI, a driven engineer, and an alien hybrid. Together we have freed the survivors of my legion and uncovered the corrupt monsters that rule humanity.</p> <p>To see the Saints cast down and my revenge complete we will need to go further. Our path will draw us to Earth, abandoned millennia ago. We will witness the mad plans of the alien invaders, the horrible masters that pull humanity’s puppet strings. Can we stop them while there is still a galaxy to burn?</p> <p>The Star Ravagers will have their vengeance, and we will leave devastation in our wake.</p>";
