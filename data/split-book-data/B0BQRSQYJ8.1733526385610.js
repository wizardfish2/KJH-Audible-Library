window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Wheelchair-bound and genetically modified at only 12-years-old, can Charlie become a super soldier? If you like an audiobook with action, coming of age troubles, and an overarching big bad evil guy, you’re going to love this....</p> <p>The Council are always watching....</p> <p>In a universe where the very existence of a civilization can be deliberated upon by a single Council of allied alien races, it is never a good idea to be the race that is practiced at war.</p> <p>Our main character, Charlie, was an average 12-year-old orphan working his way through the foster system with families and institutions that didn’t want to deal with his issues. His parents had died in a car crash when he was just three, and it had left him bitter and resentful of the world around him.<br> <br> A health scare and a surgery to remove a particularly nasty brain tumour rendered Charlie paralyzed from the neck down, and he began to grow appreciative and even loving of the Browns, his latest foster family, who had put their own lives on hold simply to care for him.</p> <p>Once an opportunity arose for Charlie to undergo experimental treatments to cure his paralysis, he jumped at the chance to remove the burden of his care from the Browns, and was transported, unknowing to him, to another planet, where he would become a cadet of the brand new arm of the earth militaries: The Space Corps.</p> <p>A cadet in a wheelchair would be difficult for the others to accept, but by finding friendships in Laura and Mauro, Charlie battled through. As a member of the GAP (Generic Advancement Program), he began to grow into something so much more than he could’ve ever imagined. Charlie would never have imagined the advancements to his physical body that the GAP Program would provide. </p> <p>Leaving his wheelchair would soon show to be the least of his trials, as he battles for the very survival of himself, his friends, planet Earth, and humanity as a whole.</p>";
