Being a mob hit man isn't a glamorous life, but he enjoys it. He finds it...serene.</p> <p>But his world is turned upside down when a phone call alerts him that he has an infant daughter, and due to the unexpected passing of her mother, Craig is thrust into fatherhood more or less against his will... Because his Boss takes family very seriously.</p> <p>But the rising star company Maid For You has come to the rescue. They send him Tori, a young half-elf, half dairy minotauress in need of a job that won't fire her by the end of her first week. At first the pair don't exactly hit it off, but there's something dangerous about Craig that Tori just understands; as it turns out, she has skeletons in her closet as well.</p> <p>Will the two of them be able to raise Craig's baby without much drama, or will the ghosts of Tori's past come back looking for her? Will Craig be able to bond with baby Cadence and learn to care for his new nanny? Or will he remain nothing but a cold-blooded killer?</p> <p>Only one way to find out.</p>";
