After he learned that his world was being forcefully inducted into something called the Retrogression System, which would introduce monsters to the Earth while eliminating all of the technology of the Humans living there, he understandably panicked.<br> <br> Unfortunately, there was nothing that Bax or the Keeper Recruit program that he suddenly found himself being enrolled in could do about it. Instead, he was told that he had to learn how to be a Keeper, which was a powerful protector of the worlds included in the System in which the Earth was now a part. More than that, he was to become a Keeper Guide, a teacher of sorts for future Human Keepers once the Retrogression cycle began anew.<br> <br> The only problem was that he had been transported from Earth while he was in the early stages of the flu he’d contracted from a co-worker. Bax’s experience being ravaged by the virus was unpleasant, to say the least, but he eventually recovered with enough rest. However, when he finally emerged from his room, ready to really start his learning as a Keeper Guide, he quickly discovered that the rest of the Cooperative seemed to be abandoned.<br> <br> Now, what is a Keeper Guide recruit to do when there’s no one left to teach him?<br> <br> <i>This story contains an overpowered main character, LitRPG progression mechanics and stats, and isekai/portal fantasy elements.
