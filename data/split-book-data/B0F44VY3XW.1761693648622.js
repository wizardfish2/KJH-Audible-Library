Marshal de Clairmont himself is badly wounded, and already at death's door.</p> <p>Duke de Bauffremont and Duke de Gondy have assembled their forces on the border between Bergonia and Vestonia, and now, under Prince Philippe's leadership, this army is about to march off to rescue the surrounded Vestonian force. But that won't be enough to beat the Golden Lion in the field. They're going to need help from another armyâ€”one which, against all odds, has managed to defeat the Atalians in three separate battles, and take control of the old Imperial road.</p> <p>Max already has what he came for: his path to the Margraviate de Valier is clear. And he has enough people to take control of his new lands. But the war in Bergonia isn't over yet . . . And while Max has his own mission to attend to, he also knows exactly where the Golden Lion will turn his attention once he defeats Prince Philippe's army.</p> <p>That means there's really only one option for Max: he needs to destroy this threat once and for all . . .</p>";
