window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Starstream!</p><p>A great interstellar migration has begun, down the grand, ethereal highway known as the starstream - from the remnant of the Betelgeuse supernova to the center of the Milky Way. Who could have predicted the wonders of the starstream, or the perils it would unleash - including the Throgs, shadowy beings of n-space that seem to understand only death and destruction? But life goes on, dangers or no, and colonists pour down the starstream seeking new worlds. Aboard starship Charity are many such colonists, including one Claudi Melnik, a child of uncommon talents - and an AI named Jeaves, with purposes of his own. When the unthinkable occurs, Claudi must face alone the challenge of the Throgs. And no one, not even Jeaves, could have predicted the final confrontation - or imagined where unexpected allies would be found.</p><p>Triumphant sequel to the best-selling <i>From a Changeling Star, Down the Stream of Stars</i> is a daring journey across the gulf between human and alien, to the heart of consciousness itself.</p><p>Named one of the best science fiction novels of the year by <i>Science Fiction Chronicle</i>.</p>";
