window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>As a mere peasant, I can't say that my life was anything but a slog.</b></p> <p>I struggled every day, looking to put something on the table, but it was my life, and no one had a right to take it. Especially not Eris Lanyer, lord of the city, the very same who was supposed to keep people such as myself safe! The nobleman killed me without a second thought for the sole purpose of testing the blade he had just acquired!</p> <p>So here I am, burning with such a rage at this flagrant lack of justice. My hate is so immense that I'm unable to pass to the afterlife, and so I return as a Revenant.</p> <p>If no one noticed my existence among the living, they sure as all hell are going to take note of me in my death… or rather undeath! A little pact with a dark deity later, and I'm now capable of growing my powers through the accumulation of Discordance shards.</p> <p>Waging war against the mighty, causing mayhem, and striking fear in the hearts of mortals will help me unlock new abilities that will bring me closer to my ultimate goal: build an Undead Kingdom and run Eris' little world into the ground! Because I don't just want the man to pay for his sins, oh no! I want to make him suffer like I did my entire life, and I will not rest until he has tasted what true misery and despair feel like.</p> <p>But wait, why can I only seem to shriek and snarl when I try to speak? And what is that atrocious pain and hunger that won't let me rest for even a second? As it turns out, life as a revenant is a little more complicated than I first thought… Oh, here's someone. Maybe he'll be able to help?</p> <p>*Shrieks*</p> <p>Oh boy…</p>";
