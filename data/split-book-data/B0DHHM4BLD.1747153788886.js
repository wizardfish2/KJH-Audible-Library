With his new Summoner’s License, Samuel is sent with a former classmate as his escort to meet Runescribe Elantrica Ilmora—someone who just might be able to discern the truth behind his odd spin on Calling Magic.</p> <p>There’s one more issue: This former classmate of his, now a nun, was his personal bully at the academy—and she’s irritatingly gorgeous. Now they have to put differences aside to get the job done, facing goblins, monsters, and the perils of the wilderness together. As a relationship develops between the pair, how will Samuel manage his nightly duties to his succubi in tandem with his complex feelings for his childhood bully?</p>";
