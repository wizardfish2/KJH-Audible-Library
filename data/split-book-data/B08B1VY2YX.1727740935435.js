Toward that end, he'll have to employ every ounce of cunning, break every rule, wrest ever advantage, and bring the very fury of the Hanged God down upon Port Gloom.</p> <p>Burning with a furious desire to crush his opponents, Kellik will return with his gorgeous rogues' gallery of companions to attack the ancient city from all sides: Using politics, assassinations, betrayals, and outright warfare, he'll stop at nothing to ensure his father's downfall.</p> <p>He's willing to risk it all. But is there a price to victory even he's not willing to pay?</p> <p><b>Warning and minor spoilers: This is an 18+ audiobook intended for mature listeners.
