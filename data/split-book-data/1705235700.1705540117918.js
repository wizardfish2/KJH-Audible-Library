window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A storm is coming, and Lazarus is the only one who can stop it.</b></p> <p>Summer in New Orleans means hot days, humid nights, and the constant threat of hurricanes. Like most people in the Big Easy, Laz has weathered his fair share of storms, but the city is about to get hit by the biggest hurricane in recorded history, a hurricane with a supernatural source.</p> <p>As the people around him prepare to evacuate, Laz is pulled into a game of cat and mouse with the Norse god, Loki. To survive, he'll have to work with old enemies and make a few new friends. To win, he'll have to beat the trickster god at his own game.</p> <p>Even if he somehow survives Loki's traps, he's got the hurricane to deal with and the monster behind it, one not even gods know how to stop. Laz has always been good at thinking outside the box, but how do you tame a hurricane?</p>";
