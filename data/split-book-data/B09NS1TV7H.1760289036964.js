And don't you dare to bring up shaving in front of him. Did I mention that the boy's favorite hobby is smithing?</p> <p>Derek always wondered if gods had sent him to the wrong world. Until, one day, Earth Awakened. With dungeons, monsters, magic, and status screens, everything became not so different from fantasy fiction or a role-playing game.... Except death was real and monsters would chase you until you experience it firsthand. The sudden change brought chaos to the world, but to the young dwarf, it also brought the opportunity to discover his true self. And maybe to reunite with his real kinfolk. But only if he survived, first.</p> <p>Who asked him to explore this abandoned mine at the worst time possible? Now Derek is trapped, and the only way to escape is to learn how this mysterious System works. Too bad there's no manual or teacher to help him with that. Or maybe there is? With his unlikely companions - a megalomaniac fairy, a polite dolphid, a twin ogre, and a mysterious cloaked girl - he's going to survive, he's going to learn, and he's going to show his talent as a Mastersmith!</p>";
