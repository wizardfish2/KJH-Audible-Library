window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>FBI agent Harmony Black and her team, Vigilant Lock, face a new type of threat: one from beyond the stars. </p> <p>They'd always heard the Red Knight was an urban legend: in 1954, three years before Sputnik launched, a mysterious satellite was sighted circling Earth, though no power on the planet had such technology. </p> <p>But the Red Knight is real, and what's more, it's inextricably linked to a supernatural force no one yet understands. Like a moth to a flame, this dark presence collides annually with the airborne satellite. Except this year the Red Knight is on course to crash-land...in Oregon. </p> <p>Vigilant Lock sets out to find the crash site and secure the remnants before the mysterious power is drawn to Earth. But they soon discover the mission is far from straightforward - and they aren't the only ones tracking the Red Knight. To stop a deadly occult threat, Harmony and her team must use all their resources: technology and sorcery, science and magic. Fortunately, Harmony has only begun to discover her growing power. </p>";
