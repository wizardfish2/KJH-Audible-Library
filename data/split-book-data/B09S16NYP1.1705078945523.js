The House has rolled out the red carpet to welcome you home.</b></p> <p>Grant looks forward to the vast megalopolis that is the District of March. He’s finally got a real companion - not just a voice in his head pretending to kill him over and again - and Suki’s perspective is invaluable. She’s a Noble, a warrior, and a noble warrior. With two months of intense physical training under his much-tightened belt, Lord January is ready to face whatever his next challenge might be.</p> <p>Dokeshi March has decided that the District needs to be fun - and what’s more fun than games of chance? More games of chance! So many, in fact, that even purchasing basic needs is a gamble. Even so, no one complains, and why would they? That would mean they thought the game wasn’t fun! That it wasn’t fair! That line of thinking would set them at odds with Dokeshi March.</p> <p>Now, there’s a bet no one would be willing to take.</p>";
