window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Regan has a new mission, given to him by the Cosmic power Creation. While his heart yearns to return to his loved ones, he can't ignore this. Not when the fate of his and an untold number of other universes depends on him taking action. Now he must cross the realm of Hellia to find a way to destroy something that seems eternal. At least he isn't alone. With Kala, some interesting residents of Hellia, and other unlikely allies joining him, Regan might finally destroy this prison once and for all.</p> <p>Louella's duty is to keep her people safe. As she seeks away to protect her people from the increasingly powerful enemies that continue to appear around the world, she also must find a way to bring Lelune to Regan. With him trapped in the realm of Hellia, that is more than a small problem. At least she isn't alone in her struggles. Friends and foes working together for a common cause, not too bad on paper.</p>";
