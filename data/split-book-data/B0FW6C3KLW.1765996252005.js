Only those who find and cure a dragon earn the right to be called Draconic Knights.</p> <p>After fifteen years of study and training, Roland has completed every step in his education but one–the stage when he must prove his worth to seek a dragon and select a Squire to accompany him from among the next class of students.</p> <p>But what should be a straightforward process in accordance with the Academy’s ancient traditions rapidly becomes a complex challenge. Roland finds himself having to choose between one of his oldest friends and another student whose impressive qualifications are matched by her equally prickly personality. And the one who fails to be chosen as a Squire will be turned out of the Academy, never to return.</p> <p>Worse, Roland’s decision soon becomes caught up in a power struggle between the Church and the city’s powerful noble families, a struggle that could ultimately bring down the Order itself. Roland can still become a Draconic Knight–at the cost of everything he’s devoted his life to.</p> <p><i>A Knight of the Dragon Academy</i> is an epic fantasy adventure of dragons, intrigue, chivalry, and honor.</p>";
