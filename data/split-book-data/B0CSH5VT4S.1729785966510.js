The reality, though, was that he was a monster hunter. Or that's how he liked to style himself.</p> <p>In a world of creatures that went bump in the night, few fought for humanity. Fewer still put humanity first. Fighting with sword, blade, or word, their numbers were insufficient.</p> <p>Those who did did so from places and situations that the world didn't appreciate or condone. That they'd actively disavow and ignore.</p> <p>Unfortunately, for those who fought such a battle, those who stared into the abyss long enough, it most certainly did indeed stare back. Stare back and set roots deep within.</p> <p>Jeremiah is about to experience when even the abyss is revealed to be nothing at all, and discovers his own truth.</p> <p>Even if it's a lie.</p>";
