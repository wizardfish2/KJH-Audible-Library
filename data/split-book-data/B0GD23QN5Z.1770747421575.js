If I wanted to face what was coming, I had to get stronger, even if it meant leaving Waybound's walls behind.</b></p> <p>My journey took me far East, into the mystical and perilous Shan Gui Highlands—a land steeped in spirits, Yokai, and watched over by powerful Mountain Gods. Alongside my loyal werewolf maid, my ascending phoenix ally, and an adventurous Goryeo princess, we navigated treacherous paths, battled ancient guardians, and sought legendary power. One destiny was reforged with divine flames, while I claimed a notorious Demon Blade, embracing the darkness necessary for survival.</p> <p>But power attracts challenges.

The Outer God Cult was already inside, their final ritual nearing completion.</p> <p>Trapped in a labyrinth designed by forgotten powers, surrounded by ruthless competitors and hidden cultists preparing to unleash an ancient horror, the true test begins.</p>";
