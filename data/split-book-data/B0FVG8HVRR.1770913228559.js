window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The cycle was never meant to be broken...until now.</b></p> <p>Deep in the shattered remnants of a dead moon, an ancient artifact pulses with Supernal Energy—power from before the Multiverse itself. The Hellmarine and his battle-scarred Stygians have stumbled onto a secret that Heaven would kill to possess and Hell would burn worlds to claim.</p> <p>But in the space between spaces, where nightmares older than demons writhe in eternal hunger, the Archduke himself delivers a terrible warning: Whoever slays the beast becomes the beast.</p> <p>Now, with the Heavenly Host descending like vultures and reality itself bending under the weight of forbidden power, the Hellmarine must navigate a conspiracy that spans from the lowest pits of Hell to the highest thrones of Heaven. Alongside him stand those who refuse to let him fall: a genius xenobiologist who anchors his humanity, a Ghost AI who defies her own limitations, an exiled angel questioning everything she once believed, and a squad of Marines too stubborn to die.</p> <p><b>He is the Hellmarine, and he will not kneel to fate.</b></p>";
