But, after Missy agrees to help her Paranormal Branch buddies and one thing leads to another...the question then becomes whether Missy can somehow provide assistance during an international crisis without the world learning about her supernatural powers and abilities. </p> <p>Meanwhile, when Missy interferes with sexual harassment at West Point by going around and putting everyone there on notice, she becomes the target. Controlling herself...doing things in plain sight which almost look humanly possible...that just might be her greatest ability. </p>";
