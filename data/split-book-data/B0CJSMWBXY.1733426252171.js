window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A primal call. Fate undeniable. A new Prime Alpha awakens.</p> <p>I used to think my life would be common, boring even. My online guildies and my friends sure thought so. Yet everything I knew to be true in this world all changed drastically one fateful night... or should I say, it shifted.</p> <p>As it turns out, my father passed on more than his name to me. Something feral and mighty awoke within me, and I knew at once, I would never be the same again. Shortly after, I received an invitation that I didn't expect, a call to attend the mysterious Apex Academy.</p> <p>A world of shifters, human animal hybrids, suddenly opened up before me. Not only were these creatures dangerous. Many were surprisingly... appealing to look at.</p> <p>Under any circumstances, the pressure to compete with fellow Alphas, the pursuit of Omega females, and of course, passing classes, would be enough. Yet it seems the gods have something special in store for me.</p> <p>For I am no mere Alpha. I'm one of the very few who wield the power of all the shifter species. I inherited my father's legacy. I'm the newest Prime Alpha.</p> <p>I just have to survive long enough to claim my power.</p>";
