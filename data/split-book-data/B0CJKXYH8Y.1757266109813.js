window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ashlock wakes in the courtyard of a demonic sect... as a tree. A tree that eats people.</p> <p>An odd start to a new life. Almost as strange as the humans flying through the skies on flaming swords and challenging the heavens. After all, this is a world where humans could chase the goal of immortality through the art of cultivation.</p> <p>But Ashlock is merely a sapling in a desolate courtyard, left alone with his thoughts and unable to speak to those passing him by.</p> <p>Unless he does something about it...</p> <p>Every day, he grows stronger as he cultivates and uses a suspicious daily sign-in system that grants him powerful skills, mutations, summons, and items, all in exchange for credits earned from eating flesh and watching the seasons pass by.</p> <p>But his peaceful life and man-eating ways can only go unnoticed for so long. His Qi-rich bark makes him a target for many young masters. If that isn't bad enough, tensions in the demonic sect are at an all-time high with the Beast Tide festers on the horizon.</p> <p>Ashlock's only option is to grow faster and stronger than any tree has ever done in the history of the nine realmsâ€”all while trying to avoid being turned into firewood.</p>";
