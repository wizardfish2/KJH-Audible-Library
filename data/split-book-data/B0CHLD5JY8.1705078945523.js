Slay the gods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When a magic ritual goes disastrously wrong, Jaden is exiled to the heart of the desert and left to die. Battered and bruised, Jaden encounters the outcast Nomadwater Sect, who grant him a second chance at life as a mysterious arcane cultivator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With its savage beasts and cryptic mysteries, survival in the sprawling desert of Southfall is a dangerous game. Yet Jaden and the Nomadwater Sect persevere, growing closer and forming bonds over the course of a long summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This changes the day the Gods kill their leader, seize the sect, and task Jaden with competing in the legendary Tournament of the Gods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>If Jaden survives the tournament, the members of his sect live. If he dies, they die alongside him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Jaden now has just ten days to rank up. Ten days to master the dragonessence system. Ten days to save those who have become his new family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Arcane cards, mana cultivation, martial arts, elemental magic, a LitRPG system, and incredible relics are all at his disposal. And even then, it might not be enough . . .</p>";
