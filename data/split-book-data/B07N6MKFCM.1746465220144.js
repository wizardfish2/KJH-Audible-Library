The Pantheon of Emerilia has gone through tremendous changes the event of Myths and Legends suppressed. </p> <p>Warships now move in the stars, made of soul-gem constructs, built by mages and engineers, crewed by those who lived on Emerilia or within Earth’s simulation. The Deq’ual system stands with Emerilia, their brothers and sisters, and their family and fellow human descendants. The Jukal Empire will not let Emerilia rise peacefully. </p> <p>As empires grow, so, too, can they be toppled. Only one can remain; in their biggest gamble yet, they must pass through the fires of war, empire against empire.</p>";
