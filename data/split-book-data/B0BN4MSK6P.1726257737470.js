window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Monsters, Mysteries, and Mayhem. Welcome to Dungeon World!</b></p> <p>It's been a year since I awoke in Dungeon World, a planet-wide RPG-themed amusement park gone haywire. With two beautiful women at my side and a suite of OP skills, I've already made a name for myself, and my party is growing as another lovely new recruit joins our ranks. Fame, fortune, and a life of luxury await!</p> <p>But the more I level, the deeper I dig, the more mysteries I uncover.</p> <p>Glitches are running rampant, changing already dangerous bosses into lethal threats. The park's back halls beckon with the promise of untold treasure, but chasing it pulls us deeper into the swirling conspiracies around the park's downfall. Will I be able to solve what's happening to Dungeon World in time to save it?</p>";
