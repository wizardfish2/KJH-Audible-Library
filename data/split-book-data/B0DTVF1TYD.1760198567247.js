One that's going to need his help to fix it, whether anyone wants it to happen, including Wrench, or not.</p> <p>Now that the Tongsta are firmly aware that Hume and Grae are living creatures, life is changing. Wrench and his people are working the part of a crew and earning their keep. Being treated as equals of worth instead of pets.</p> <p>Except even as things change, there will always be problems that spring up. Things that break all on their own. Which will of course require Wrench to fix it and anything that gets in his way.</p> <p>At this point though, he's getting tired of fixing everything and everyone that comes his way and his patience is wearing thin. The fix-it list only grows and the tools he has at his disposal are getting worn out.</p> <p>With any luck, this job will be done and Wrench can take some time off.</p>";
