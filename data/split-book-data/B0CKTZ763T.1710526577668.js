With Earth in limbo, and a lost colony likely in need of help, he knows his vacation is on borrowed time. He owes the Merchant Marines, Pavia, and humanity itself to do more, to be more.</p> <p>So when life is turned upside down again, he ventures back into the stars, helping those he can, when he can. The adventure is intense, his family bonds are tight, and the dangers ever-present.</p> <p><b>And yet, Darius isn't afraid to take his ships to the red-line in the name of victory!</b></p>";
