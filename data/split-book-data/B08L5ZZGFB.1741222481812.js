window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A palace lost in time. A revolution in flames. A betrayal brought to light.</b></p> <p>Woken from his long slumber into a new and dangerous world, Lord Aziel was a legend before he could recall his own name. At great personal cost, he has successfully built a following in the most isolated reaches of Kadora - only to be struck down by the mysterious World Seed whose true intentions remain unknown.</p> <p>Brought back from the brink of death by his beautiful Succubus Celia and proud Queen Astrel, Aziel finds his actions have attracted the attention of powerful enemies. With a Blood Curse sweeping across the neighboring lands and the specter of war looming, he must look beyond the Wilds if he is to survive and defend those he has pledged to protect.<br> <br> It is an undertaking that will test the limits of Azielâ€™s powers and force him to question what it means to be a true leader. It will also bring him answers to the deepest questions about himself and his own existence: who had imprisoned him for all those centuries, and why? And what is he prepared to sacrifice to keep his loved ones safe?</p> <p>Combining elements of fantasy, GameLit, and thriller, this second installment in the Seeded Realms will change everything you thought you knew about Kadora - and beyond.</p> <p><b>Warning: </b>This book contains scenes of graphic violence and non-traditional relationship structures.</p>";
