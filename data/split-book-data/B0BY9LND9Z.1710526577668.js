Sure, losing every time was a pain, but the money was good. Well, decent. And it kept real heroes off my back. Well, usually.</p> <p>But then I got called in to train a new villainess in the fine art of menace, and suddenly I'm dealing with rogue heroes, horny scientists, yandere psychics, and in the crosshairs of one of the biggest bad guys the world has ever known. It's a good thing I'm a villain, because it's time to start breaking some rules....</p>";
