Sun, surf, and sultry shifter girls . . .</b></p> <p>The beachside town of Oyster Cove had everything a man could want—endless white sand beaches, plentiful summer activities, and of course, more beautiful women than you could shake a tail at. I came to Oyster Cove to enjoy a leisurely summer of surf and sun, but I find out pretty quickly that there’s more to this town than meets the eye.</p> <p>My next door neighbor has eyes that are very similar to a cat’s, and I could have sworn the gorgeous waitress at my favorite food spot has scales on her legs. Maybe I’ve been out in the sun too long, but when a foxy redhead asks me to join her volleyball team, I get pulled into a world that I never knew existed.</p> <p>And for some reason, all these shifter girls are interested in me.</p> <p>It looks like my summer is going to heat up quickly.</p>";
