window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Even a master thief can steal one thing too many.</i></p> <p>From a childhood as an abandoned orphan to life as one of the city’s most skilled burglars, master thief Rafiq has long lived high off the wealth of Avanasia—its trade, its jewels, and its women. The vaults of Avanasia's merchants are as open to him as the legs of its most beautiful courtesans.</p> <p>For in Avanasia, there is but one paramount truth: There are those who have, and those who take.</p> <p>And Rafiq is one of the latter.</p> <p>But when he steals an ancient heirloom blade from a powerful merchant, he sets in motion a series of events that will shift the delicate balance of power in the city. And he’ll need to assemble a unique and talented harem of girls to survive.</p> <p><i>Master of Thieves: The Complete Series</i> contains both volumes in this dark-fantasy harem adventure.</p>";
