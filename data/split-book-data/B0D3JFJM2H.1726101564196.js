The UC wants something, and it's down to Steve to figure out how to pay that debt or survive without their sheltering hand.</p> <p>The greater galaxy is a harsh place, and in the eyes of those who battle to keep the flame of freedom alive another day, anyone who would give up their freedom to gain a little security? In the galaxy's eyes, they'd deserve neither.</p>";
