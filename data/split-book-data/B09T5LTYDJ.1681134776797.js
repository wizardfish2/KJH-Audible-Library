There, with only his paladin's sigil and his quests to guide him, Darren grew from boy to man. Born in fire and blood, hell itself sculpted the perfect paladin.</p> <p>Years later, after a lifetime of fighting demons and battling a world full of nightmares, Darren finally returned to the surface. But, the world above ground has just as many trials to face as hell itself, and not all of Darren's enemies are demons.
