God has given him a choice: to take the life of the person meant to die that day and forget who he was, or to keep being Alex and transition to a world of magic where God would give him the tools to survive. Alex, an avid fan of fantasy, chooses the latter and is thrown through a black portal into a world he never could have imagined.</p> <p>Once there, he discovers that he has the ability to wield all five Elemental magics: Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and Mind. But the power is changing him, and he is quickly learning that his title as \"The Elemental Summoner\" is feared by everyone in the world of Boromour. Every thousand years, an Elemental Summoner is born who can wield all five Elemental magics and usually ends up destroying everything around them in their quest for power. Alex must learn to control his powers before it's too late.</p> <p>As he navigates this new world, Alex meets sexy, powerful monster girls who may be able to help him control his power and keep him from becoming evil.
