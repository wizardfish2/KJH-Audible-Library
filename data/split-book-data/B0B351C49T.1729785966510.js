Unlimited power up for grab.</b></p> <p>The Galactic Consensus arrived on ships as large as skyscrapers, crafted from glittering alloys that no human scientist could even begin to understand. They followed the trail of century-old television transmissions to welcome us into the galactic community...only to recoil in horror at what they found.</p> <p>They concluded that humans were unfit to be trusted with the advanced technologies that member-states of the Consensus freely traded with each other, installing a relay to warn other ships that we were under embargo, but more importantly, allowing humans entrance into the Tower of Somnus, a multiplayer game of sorts that could be played in oneâ€™s sleep. The hope was that humanity would learn proper behavior from playing the game with our more civilized neighbors.</p> <p>Katherine \"Kat\" Debs, a hereditary employee of one of the megacorporations that ruled the world, eked out a meager existence in a massive arcology of glittering glass and chrome. She dreamt of one day earning enough money to buy her freedom and was more than willing to break a law here or there in the process. When she is offered an opportunity to enter the Tower of Somnus free of corporate control, she jumps at the chance. After all, the \"game\" was more than just a status symbol; players retained the fantastic powers they earned in the game in the waking world as well.</p> <p>A perfect opportunity to take control of her destiny or die trying.</p>";
