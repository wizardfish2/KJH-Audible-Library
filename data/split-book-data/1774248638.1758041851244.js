These were not all warmagi, nor even High Magi; indeed, the strength of Sevendor depended on magi of all types and descriptions.</p> <p>As Minalan fought against the darkest foes in the West, his lands in the east were protected by his vassals, allies, and friends. Their powers varied, as did their station. But they were uniformly devoted to Minalan the Spellmonger and the land he had wrought. They kept watch against secret incursions or hidden dangers against the realm while the Spellmonger’s strength was elsewhere. Whilst he grappled with the fearsome minions of Korbal the Necromancer, his magical land was well-warded by the famous Wizards of Sevendor.</p> <p>From the Heeth the Arcanist’s History of the Magelands.</p>";
