window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Guild Collective is applying pressure. Combat is heating up. That’s how diamonds are made.</b></p> <p>Rockland is reeling from the loss of his family. All he found of them were missing limbs after the battle for New York, where the heavyweights of Empire and the Mechanolords fought. Only dangerous combat and bear wrestling were able to take his mind off the tragedy, but for a Chimera Knight those battles turned into new Territories across the massive, now borderless, country once called Canada.</p> <p>Pulled from the path of self-destruction at the last moment, Rocky learns how to better use violence to achieve his goals in the apocalypse. Meliora’s enemies have allied and joined up to wipe out anyone in their way. Only because of his increased senses does Rocky find hints that the Grotto’s attempted extinction is a cover. Its reason? To keep humanity's attention on survival and away from something far greater. There’s a secret the Mechanolords are concealing, a place of power they need to access to achieve their true goals: the lost city of Atlantis.</p> <p><i>Everyone needs the oldest place of power in existence for their own reasons, but the Legendary guardian of the city would rather destroy the planet than fail to protect the newly arisen sanctum.</i></p>";
