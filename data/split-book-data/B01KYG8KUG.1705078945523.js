A little collateral damage to city hall and all of a sudden you're Public Enemy Number One. </p> <p>But I'm doing some policing myself. Got my own Cisco's Most Wanted. Pop quiz: Who's more dangerous? A conspiratorial mage, a volcanic elemental, or a dirty Miami politician? </p> <p>The answer might surprise you because I never saw it coming. </p>";
