window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Beware what you wish for. You just might achieve it.</b></p> <p>Kellik and his band have accomplished their goals, and now must reap their bitter rewards. Ruling Port Gloom is a vastly different enterprise from seeking to decapitate its government, and as the world begins to fall apart, he must decide what matters most: being the fair and just ruler, or surviving to see the dawn.</p> <p>For the consequences of his sins are coming home to roost. A world destroying power is making its way to his city, and it will stop at nothing in its quest for vengeance. </p> <p><b>Warning and minor spoilers: This is an 18+ audiobook intended for mature listeners. It contains graphic sex, medieval violence, and nudity.</b></p>";
