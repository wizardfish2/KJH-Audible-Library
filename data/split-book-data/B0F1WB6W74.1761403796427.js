window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When a despised isekai author's novel comes to life, she's challenged by opponents far more sinister than any demon or god: her past critics—and karma.</b></p> <p>Liu Peijin has spent the last decade of her life writing a widely read—and very trashy—LitRPG web novel. Too bad her readers don't really like the book . . . or the author. But who can blame them? Peijin is bitter and far more interested in challenging negative reviews and blocking all critics than engaging with fans. Until one day, after arguing with a commenter, she receives an ominous message: \"Tomorrow, 1 p.m. I have a surprise for you.\"</p> <p>Sure enough, the next day the Azure Dragon of Peijin's story appears on the freeway before her and slaughters dozens of humans in a flash. Additionally, blue screens flash all around, and murderous goblins flood the streets. Soon, divinities, demons, and ghosts are investing in humans to fight for their entertainment. Peijin swiftly realizes the first chapter of her book has infected her world.</p> <p>Technically, she has the knowledge and skills she needs to survive. It's her insufferable man of a protagonist she's worried about. Oh, and all those reviewers she blocked are now gods passing cosmic judgment on her. After years of enduring her disparagement, they can't wait to see her suffer. And one of them—who, by the way, Peijin is certain never existed in her novel—somehow knows more than the author herself . . .</p> <p>The thrilling start to an imaginative gamelit series, <i>Scathing Reviewer</i> is perfect for anyone who's ever wondered, <i>What would the writer do?</i></p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 170,000 views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
