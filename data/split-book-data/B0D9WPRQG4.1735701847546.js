window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Permits, arcane power, and a sharp sword—just the tools you’ll need to fix up a magical mansion!</b></p> <p>Ever since the System invaded Earth, I had dreamt of becoming a powerful wizard. Sure, the manor I picked as my lair was a rundown, haunted dump, and a crazy cult had tried to murder me, but it all worked out in the end. I even picked up a few house guests–a sexy ghost, a Drow blacksmith, and a tricksy Arachne scholar</p> <p>We are settling into our new normal—home repairs, researching the dark past of my hometown, and delving into frigid dungeons—when we discover a thief draining mana from my lair. They’re threatening everything I built.</p> <p>Beyond defeating the thief, paying my mortgage, and expanding my lair, I’ll have to deal with a group of wannabe heroes trying to take over the town. It’ll take every bit of magic I have, and a bit of insane courage, to defeat these perils and protect my new home.</p> <p>If I’m lucky, I’ll still be in one piece to enjoy date night once this is over!</p>";
