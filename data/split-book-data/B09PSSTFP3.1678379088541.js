window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Jason has discovered that his homeworld is not what he thought. Whatâ€™s more, the rest of the planet is on the precipice of sharing his revelation.</b></p> <p>With magic on the rise and forces pulling him in multiple directions, Jason is faced with challenges greater than ever before.</p> <p>Even as his power reaches new and incredible heights, he is faced with the realization that going beyond his best is still not enough.</p> <p><b>About the series:</b> Experience an isekai culture clash as a laid-back Australian finds himself in a very serious world. See him gain suspiciously evil powers through a unique progression system combining cultivation and traditional LitRPG elements. Enjoy a weak-to-strong story with a main character who earns his power without overshadowing everyone around him, with plenty of loot, adventurers, gods and magic. Rich characters and world-building offer humor, political intrigue and slice-of-life elements alongside lots of monster fighting and adventure.</p>";
