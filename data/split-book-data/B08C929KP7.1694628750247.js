window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Hunt the mesmer. Free the captives. Be the hero you never wanted to be.</b></p> <p>It's been 10 days since Jade finally got out. Out of the bed she spent her life trapped in, out of the hospital, and now out of the city, the walls, and way outside of her comfort zone.</p> <p>The wilderness is a terrifying place, especially when you're hunting mesmer...and everything else is hunting you. Unfortunately, getting out of the forest won't get her out of the woods. She’ll need to navigate court politics and foreign policy if she wants to come out in one piece. Paving a way through state affairs will prove at least as difficult as trying to find her way through Basaigh Woods.</p> <p>Andara’s newest traveler has a lot on her plate; it’s a good thing she’s hungry for adventure!</p>";
