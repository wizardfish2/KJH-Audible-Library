Sure, her father is the famous house witch of Daxaria so she was raised among majestic castles, proper manners, and royal expectations. But Kat is also a mutated witch whose power aligns predominantly with fire. She’s more comfortable riding horses or learning to fight than she is making polite conversation and wearing fancy dresses. Which is why her upcoming assignment—serving her best friend, Alina, the soon-to-be crowned Troivackian queen—is anything but ideal.</p> <p>Even worse, Kat is forced to make the long journey from Daxaria to Troivack with Alina’s extremely irksome brother, Eric, the crown prince of Daxaria. Kat and the formerly missing prince are constantly at each other’s throats—until, that is, they begin to form an unexpected kinship . . . with perhaps something more flickering beneath the surface. Now Kat must contend with the strictures of Troivackian court, mysterious assassination attempts, and her unsettling new feelings for Eric, all as her fiery powers are becoming harder and harder to control.</p> <p>In this fast-paced, humorous, and romantic start to the Burning Witch<i> </i>trilogy, the same charming magical mayhem that wooed fans of the House Witch series gets a brightly burning new star in Katarina Ashowan.</p> <p><b>The first volume of a new spin-off of the hit romantic-fantasy series that has more than a million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
