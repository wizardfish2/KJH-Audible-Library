Because I got ripped from an airplane on my way home after my last day in the Coast Guard.</p> <p>I mean, come on, I wasn’t even in one of the hardcore branches of the military or anything!</p> <p>On top of that, as soon as I arrived in this new world, I got sent to jail and conscripted.</p> <p>So, that was fun.</p> <p>But I found out I was unique. The first human on Camaria to have an affinity for all three of the elements humans had taken from the dungeons.</p> <p>Fire, Earth, and Water.</p> <p>Now, I’m being sent to this academy. It’s a place to learn how to be the hero they expect — no, the hero they need me to be. To save humanity and all the other races I guess.</p> <p>I mean, we all have to start somewhere, right?</p> <p>Oh, and there is this girl. Okay, maybe more than one…</p> <p>Anyway, this is my journey. The chronicles of how I went from Mr. Average to the most powerful Hexinblade this world has ever known.</p>";
