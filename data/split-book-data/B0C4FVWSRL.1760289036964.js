They like their hierarchies, they hate disrespect, and if you leave one out in deep space long enough, they'll go homicidally insane.</p> <p>It turns out, there's a reason for that. Away from all the gravity wells and biospheres that generate natural energy, things get just quiet enough to notice the infinite ocean of qi entirely incompatible with our own.</p> <p>I should know. I've seen it.</p> <p>Only difference is, I didn't go mad. I wasn't a cultivator. Technically, I wasn't even alive.</p> <p>But now I can sense it. I can touch it.</p> <p>I can cultivate it.</p> <p>From the best-selling author of <i>This Trilogy is Broken! </i>and<i> Dungeon Devotee </i>comes the cultivation epic you've been waiting for.</p>";
