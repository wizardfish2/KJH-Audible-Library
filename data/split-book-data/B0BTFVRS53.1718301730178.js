What awaits our dauntless protagonist?</p> <p>A gray sky, one where the stars never shine, is overhead. A white sand made of ground bones is underfoot. That is the horror of the Demon Lands. But the dragon's heart in his chest will not give in, and it will keep beating steadily. He will not falter.</p> <p>The Blue Blade will never be lowered in surrender. An indomitable will still shines in the eyes of Hadjar Darkhan, the Wind of the Northern Valleys. He'll endure whatever fate throws at him.</p>";
