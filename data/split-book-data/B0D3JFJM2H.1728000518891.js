That protection, offered as it is with the full knowledge that it could embroil billions in a new war? It's never going to come cheap. The UC wants something, and it's down to Steve to figure out how to pay that debt or survive without their sheltering hand.</p> <p>The greater galaxy is a harsh place, and in the eyes of those who battle to keep the flame of freedom alive another day, anyone who would give up their freedom to gain a little security? In the galaxy's eyes, they'd deserve neither.</p>";
