window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This three-in-one audiobook bundle contains the Goblin Mode LitRPG series in its entirety, following Bogart as he tries to escape the badlands.</p> <p><i>For the Loot 1</i>:</p> <p>Bogart casts aside his humble origins, becoming an adventurer. He must gain levels in the guild and fight alongside his allies, both within and outside the law. For fame and fortune! Maybe even to save the world. But mostly for fame and fortune!</p> <p>You only get one chance at the big leagues, and nobody knows it better than Bogart. He's going straight from the badlands to the top of the world, or he'll gladly die trying. If only he knew the truth about the life he's chosen. There are wars, dark gods, and eldritch horrors on the horizon. And nothing is as it seems. Join Bogart as he quests for riches!</p> <p><i>For the Loot 2</i>:</p> <p>Bogart returns to the safety of the city victorious, only to find that trouble has come home. The lands are poisoned now, and the monsters are stronger than ever. A plot for power brews in Galhim, and no one can be trusted. Together, the party must settle their debts, come, and seize back their fates. To steal what belongs to a dark god, the course of history must be changed forever.</p> <p><i>For the Loot 3</i>:</p> <p>Now back from the dead, Bogart must face the most fearsome beast there is, the greatest of all the monsters. A dragon and its fortune is the key to survival, and there's no settling for second best when your foe is fate itself. Every throne and every coin must be taken, and the mystery of the gods must be solved. This time, it's personal.</p>";
