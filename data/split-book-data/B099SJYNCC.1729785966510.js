The Franklin was destroyed, and his core is slowly dying. </p> <p>Discovered by those who seek to use him for profit, Slater is taken to Sarton Station. His captors intend to use him for their own amusements, but they have made a deadly mistake. They have placed a derelict core right where he wants to be, in a station surrounded by all the salvage and biomass he needs to recover his mind and rebuild the Franklin. </p> <p>Slater needs to work quickly, as a new threat emerges from the darkness of space, a threat more deadly than the council, a threat that has its sights set on Earth. </p>";
