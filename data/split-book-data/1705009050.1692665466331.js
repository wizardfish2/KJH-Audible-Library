Tolkien’s beloved </b><b><i>The Hobbit </i></b><b>will be coming to listeners everywhere this September, read by the BAFTA award-winning actor, director and author, Andy Serkis.</b></p> <p>Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely travelling further than the pantry of his hobbit-hole in Bag End. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard, Gandalf, and a company of 13 dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day, to whisk him away on a journey \"there and back again\". They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon…&nbsp;</p> <p>The prelude to <i>The Lord of The Rings</i>,<i> the Hobbit</i> has sold many millions of copies since its publication in 1937, establishing itself as one of the most influential books of the 20th century.</p>";
