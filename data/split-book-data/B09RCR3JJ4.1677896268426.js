window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The apocalypse is coming…can one war hero stop it?</b></p> <p>Maximo Strident, war veteran and member of local law enforcement, never wanted to enter the dungeon. With promises of wealth beyond his imagination, his squad mates managed to convince him.</p> <p>Max isn’t a Knight, so he has no magical equipment or spells that could help him against monsters. What he does have, however, are the sword forms he learnt at the Blade Academy. These forms are formidable martial arts that make him the match of Level 0 monsters. But Level 99 monsters? He doesn’t stand a chance.</p> <p>When something goes horribly wrong inside the dungeon, Max meets the legendary hero: Artur Brightblade. This hero grants him something he never dreamed of: a unique class and the ability to become a Knight.</p> <p>Armed with this new class and the powers it provides, Maximo is going to clean up the Knights-Errant and solve the mystery of the dungeon. He’ll have to learn how to cast spells, work within a cohort, level up most effectively, and craft war gear worthy of his class. If he doesn’t, the apocalypse will destroy everything he knows and loves.</p>";
