window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The one last ring might be one ring too many....</b></p> <p>Ymir now has six beautiful wives, seven Akkiric Rings, and only a year left before he graduates from Old Ironbound - if war doesn’t kill them all first. The demon king from the southern continent has come to conquer Thera, but there's a new winged warrior at the school who might have the secret to stopping him.</p> <p>And that secret includes forging the last magical ring. Delving into forbidden texts, dabbling in alchemical necromancy, and uncovering the obscure history of an ancient deathless emperor, Ymir and his wives have never been closer to understanding the true nature of the Lonely Man’s curse.</p> <p>To finish his journey, the barbarian cursed by magic will need more potions, more wives, and one final, delicious encounter the whole harem has been waiting for. One thing is for sure—demons or not, Ymir won’t stop until he has conquered the world.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer: </b><i>Barbarian Conqueror</i> is a steamy, slice-of-life harem adventure in a magic university, on another world. The sex scenes are explicit, but don’t get in the way of the story as it slowly unfolds. Enter a dark fantasy world from the mind of Aaron Crash, the best-selling author of the American Dragon series.</p>";
