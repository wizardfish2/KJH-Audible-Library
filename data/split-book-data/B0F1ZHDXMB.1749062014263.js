window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When the dead whisper, the wise listen.</b></p> <p>Marek's simple life shatters the moment he inherits a Class of legend. As the newly awoken Remnant Mage, his body, mind, and core begin a relentless transformation. Gifted—or cursed—with the ability to perceive the ethereal world, Marek must learn to command the lingering spirits that haunt its unseen depths.</p> <p>But great power invites greater danger. A kingdom seeks to use him as a weapon, and the Rift that divides the Twin Realms is beginning to weaken. The host of demons trapped within will escape, and when they do, the apocalypse will follow.</p> <p>With his own mind betraying him and the fate of the world on his shoulders, Marek will need more than power to survive. He'll need the trust and loyalty of two fate-bound allies sworn to the same cause.</p> <p><i>Blending epic fantasy, LitRPG, and cultivation, </i>Remnant Mage <i>is ideal for fans of He Who Fights with Monsters, Cradle, and The Beginning After the End. Expect a weak to OP MC, a character-driven plot told from a third-person PoV focused almost exclusively on the MC, a unique hybrid class, blending summoner and DPS tank abilities, a dual progression system: LitRPG and Cultivation, slice of life moments, and a slow-burn romance with zero spicy bits. Contains intense violence, language, and content for mature listeners.</i></p>";
