Then he was drafted as its captain to suppress a 5,000-year-old mutiny. And then he had to mobilize the planet against the attack of an eons-old ancient menace dedicated to the eradication of all intelligent life in the galaxy!&nbsp;</p> <p>It's hard to blame him for feeling a little stressed, but there's something Colin MacIntyre doesn't know about all the things he's had to do.&nbsp;</p> <p>They were the easy part.</p>";
