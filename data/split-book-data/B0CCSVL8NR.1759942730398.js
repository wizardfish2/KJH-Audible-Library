This barren region is a far cry from the lush forest she had just left, as there is nothing living amongst the endless sand dunes that sweep across the landscape.</p> <p>After adapting to the strange new dungeons and the odd fire- and heat-based monsters that are found in the Desert, Tempara finds that—with help from the souls of a few former Defenders and her rescued family—she's grown quite adept at defending her dungeon from whatever comes her way.</p> <p>But like the mirage-like heat haze that perpetually lies over the scorching desert, a familiar—and dangerous—figure will emerge to challenge the time-looping Dungeon Core in their own powerful element.</p> <p><i>This story contains Dungeon Core elements, including dungeon construction and defense, and LitRPG/GameLit mechanics such as character progression and stats. It does not contain harems, sexual content, or profanity.</i></p>";
