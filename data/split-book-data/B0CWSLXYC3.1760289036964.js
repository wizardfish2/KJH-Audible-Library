Dragged against his will through a yawning purple vortex by a mouthy catgirl, he finds himself in another world full of vivid colors—and peerless beauties. Cowgirls, lamias, satyresses, unicorns, and even elves of all colors of the rainbow make his acquaintance early and often...and he handles them pretty darn well for a random fast food worker in over his head.</p> <p>That's the way things are going to be from now on. On Lusteria, the population is largely female and made up of monster women and elves. There is the odd transmigrated human here and there, but Bucky is special. He’s been chosen.</p> <p>But chosen for what?</p> <p>The three Dark Queens must be defeated. Bucky isn’t totally sold on the idea, though, not just yet. For now, he’s satisfied to just enjoy the simple life in Tater Town, the small, dumbly-named village he’s grown to call home.</p> <p><b>He’ll get around to being a hero…eventually.</b></p>";
