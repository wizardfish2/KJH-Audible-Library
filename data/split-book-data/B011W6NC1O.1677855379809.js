window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There Be Monsters Here.... </p><p>It's not as great as you'd think, living in a tourist town that's known as \"the most magical place in America\". Same boring high school, just twice as many monsters under the bridges and rival Families killing each other for power. I try to keep out of it. I've got my mom's bloodiron sword and my slightly illegal home in the basement of the municipal library. And a couple of Talents I try to keep quiet, including very light fingers and a way with a lock pick. </p><p>But then some nasty characters bring their Family feud into my friend's pawn shop, and I have to make a call - get involved or watch a cute guy die because I didn't. I guess I made the wrong choice, because now I'm stuck putting everything on the line for Devon Sinclair. My mom was murdered because of the Families, and it looks like I'm going to end up just like her.... </p>";
