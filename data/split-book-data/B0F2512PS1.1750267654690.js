Lysandra was the only woman that Frost chose to marry and she was also the future mother of his child. <br> <br> He thought that after marrying Lysandra he would be finished marrying women he just met but it seemed he was mistaken. <br> <br> In the heat of the moment, he made a reckless wager that resulted in him being engaged to Olivia Moray, a noblewoman from the obscenely wealthy Moray family. If he married Olivia, he would have access to her vast fortune. If he didn't marry her, the Moray family would take it as a grave insult. It was an easy choice to make. <br> <br> Frost had more important things to deal with, like his agreement with the Goddess Riliandra. <br> <br> The goddess found her next prophet and per their deal, Frost needed to protect her. The only problem was that the cute demihuman prophet in question was located in Nir, a country that did not welcome visitors and happened to be at war with Rilia. <br> <br> Frost was going to have to find a way to smuggle himself into the country, find the prophet, and escape. All without getting the attention of the Herald of Niri, a powerful sorceress rumored to be immortal. <br> <br> <i>Herald of Shalia is a fun fantasy light LitRPG/Gamelit by Tamryn Tamer and contains attention starved elves, naughty harpies, creative catgirls, foxy madams, foul language, and completely over the top love making. You've been warned.</i></p>";
