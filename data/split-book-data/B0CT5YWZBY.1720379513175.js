With no way out of the village on his own, he had always held onto the hope that one day his magic would awaken and give him access to his spheres.</p> <p>But he’s about to turn eighteen and it’s never come. Instead, he’s settled into his lot as a sarcastic and quick-witted innkeeper.</p> <p>That all changes one night when his old flame, who escaped the village to become a mage’s anchor, returns.</p> <p>Ard’s life is about to go through some dramatic changes, and he’s not ready for them.</p> <p>Too bad, with magic comes responsibility and Ard needs to adapt quickly because he’s making more enemies than friends with his glib tongue. Thankfully, he’s got some help along the way.</p> <p>Because he’ll need it. As the most powerful mage in the nation, he’s about to be thrown headfirst into the elite of the kingdom and a few jokes won’t stop a sword.</p>";
