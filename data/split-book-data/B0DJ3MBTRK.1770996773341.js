Only this time he will have to worry about more than just the next wave of undead, as other survivors have their own ideas about how the world should be run. Will Jason find compromise, or is the only way forward to remove those who refused to have his will imposed upon them?</p> <p>Either way, Jason is going to be very busy as he gets ready to secure the region against all threats and that means once he's done with the area around Mt. Whitney, it will be time to head for Las Vegas.</p> <p>Caitlin's journey also continues, as she and Onibi hope that they have found safety on a Mediterranean island after escaping the deserts of Egypt.</p>";
