window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If you could be the first to lay eyes upon a planet orbiting a distant star, would you go?</p> <p>If it meant that when you returned home - if you returned home - everyone you knew would have been dead for centuries, would you still go?</p> <p>The members of the Polaris Project knew what they were giving up when they volunteered to fly to the star named Angel-21, but the allure of being the first explorers to leave the Solar System far outweighed the risks. As it turned out, the most dangerous thing they faced wasn't the mission...it was the homecoming. Eight hundred years have passed, and Earth is nothing like they thought it would be.</p> <p>As Commander Markus Brentwood scrambles to uncover the mystery of what's happened to Earth in their absence, he also must contend with an increasingly dysfunctional crew and a damaged ship that's flying on borrowed time. What should have been a joyous return home after a long, hard mission has turned into a race to see which nightmare would kill them first.</p>";
