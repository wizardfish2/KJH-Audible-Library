And literal nightmares out to kill a young boy.</p> <p>Gray Lexly, son of a candlemaker, wants to escape his life of old-world technologies and study at the prestigious Astra Academy, a school for arcanistsâ€”those who can wield magic. But Gray has a major problem. Every night, as he sleeps, he's visited by monsters. When they injure Gray in his dreams, he wakes with the same wounds in real life . . .</p> <p>On the night Gray might finally die in his nightmares, he is saved by the kind and mysterious Professor Helmith, a powerful arcanist. She offers to protect Gray and invites him to attend Astra Academy.</p> <p>Before that can happen, Gray must bond with a mystical creature to become an arcanist himself. Will he bond with a unicorn?
