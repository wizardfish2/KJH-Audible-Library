window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A Cultivation Progression Epic.</p> <p>What happens when the soul of an old soldier collides with that of a young cultivator in the River of Fate, where destinies twine together on the path to rebirth? The unlikely event has ramifications that will shake the heavens.</p> <p>The memories of the two souls combine into one individual, who is reborn by a command so powerful it warps reality itself. Finding himself alone, Verse must discover who he is and develop the strength to survive in a world where cultivation is the only law.</p> <p>Fortunately, he's good at that.</p> <p>In this story, you can expect Xianxia-style immortal cultivation, reincarnation, a focus on jade and sunset magic, sects, alchemy, formations, ancient races, and a hero who is evolving and changing to become more than he was before.</p> <p>There is no harem here. You'll find a cool-headed MC who is becoming a strong lead, increasing progression/cultivation, and a developing non-human theme.</p>";
