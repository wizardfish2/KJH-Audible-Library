With time running out, the All-Father Odin himself, searches all the worlds for one last warrior who might hold back the destruction threatening Nine Realms and every world created.</p> <p>Magnus’s death caught the All-Father’s one good eye.</p> <p>As an Army Ranger, he knew he was placing himself in the line of fire every day, and knew a day could come that cost him his life. What he didn't want was the rest of his team would be wiped out with him, the worst disaster the Rangers had experienced in decades.</p> <p>Summoned before the All-Father, Magnus is given the grave news and outcome for every realm including his own.</p> <p>A deal was struck, a bargain made—Be reborn in Midgard, empower himself through mystical runes, and battle Odin's foes, in exchange for his team also getting a second lease on life if Magnus should succeed.</p> <p>Waking up in a small farming village in Midgard, Magnus must now train and battle, both mundane foes and the creatures out of myths and legends, in both Midgard, and the rest of the Nine Realms.</p>";
