window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The war for control of Faeland has begun, but the victors may very well have nobody to rule over once the battles come to an end.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the four World Beasts now battling, the land itself is splitting apart, forcing the dwarves and elves from their homelands as they march ever eastward to confront Shedra and the Arcane Kingdom. Sarah’s return doesn’t solve all of Morgan’s problems. On the contrary, he now knows he’s made enemies of all of the agents of Chaos. Additionally, the cultists of Strangler have overstepped their boundaries, and when something precious is stolen, Morgan refuses to take it lying down.</p> <p>Warning: This book contains profanity, gore, and content that may not be suitable for children. This book also contains GameLit elements, such as stat sheets, a form of leveling, and experience gain.</p>";
