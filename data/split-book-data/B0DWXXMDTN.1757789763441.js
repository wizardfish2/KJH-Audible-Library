And on top of that, he finds himself caring for an injured werewolf girl, reuniting with his manic yandere lab assistant, and gathering allies to fight a mechanized industrialist looking to usurp him.</p> <p>Because while he might not be mad, he is the master of Grimmwald Castle. And no one’s taking that or the women who love him without a fight.</p>";
