Mine may have just cost me my life.</b></p> <p>After rescuing my father from Kalidan's Mage Tower and eradicating the council, we sought to head to Eylsarin and seek sanctuary with the elves. But the Archon was one step ahead and caught up to us before we could flee the country.</p> <p>Now, I stand accused of murder, not to mention treason. A twisted kind of luck remains on my side, however, as the Archon has need of a man with my skills.</p> <p>To sweeten the deal, the rewards offered prove far more valuable than my freedom alone.</p> <p>It seems the Archon knows what I am, about the abilities I possess. If I complete her task, not only will she wipe the slate clean, but will reveal the truth about why I can do what no other mage can.</p> <p>As eager as I am, my task will be anything but easy.</p> <p>Something strange is happening at the fringes of Arcadia, and it's up to Alex, Syl, Marrow, and me to stop it. What waits lurking in the dark is a threat far more deadly than any could expect.</p> <p>One that could destroy the country, if not the entire world.</p>";
