Newly narrated in June 2018. </p> <p>\"This is not your usual alien vs humanity novel\" </p> <p>You have to feel sorry for an alien who wakes up on Earth after hibernating for millennia only to find his own race gone - destroyed centuries earlier by a ruthless hive of artificial intelligence. All that remains are humans, who have yet to evolve sufficiently to bypass their own shortcomings and unify as a race to work toward a common goal. </p> <p>The alien, Zirkos, chooses to befriend a US Vet named Zeke Callaghan who possesses a rare component he needs to complete his spaceship's revival - an exotic meteor fragment currently buried in Zeke's head. A bond is forged between the two bringing with it remarkable technological advances in personal safety and an end to humanity's incessant demand for war. The breakthrough ultimately proves a catalyst to launch humanity into space. </p> <p>From there events quickly take on a life of their own as the duo battle to bring Earth to a state of readiness to defend them from the approaching threat of 'The Nubl'. </p>";
