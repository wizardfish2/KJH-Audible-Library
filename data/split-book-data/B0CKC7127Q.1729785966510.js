window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>How do you stop an invasion force that just defeated the most powerful person on the planet? Chances are, you don’t.</b></p> <p>But the world’s greatest heroes and villains are going to team up and make their best attempt.</p> <p>After the Tuldarians—a race of dinosaur-like aliens—invade the Earth with overwhelming numbers of ships and soldiers, the world’s governments finally repeal the Anti-Vigilante Acts. Now, the masked crimefighters and criminals who haven’t been allowed to use their powers are being asked to fight to save humanity. And to think, I was just put in prison for just trying to be a good guy.</p> <p>However, with the recent knowledge that the Tuldarians have developed a way of stripping us from superpowers, that could prove more difficult than it seems—in fact, it could be a suicide mission.</p> <p>My name is Sawyer William Vincent (I know, it's three first names. Think I haven't heard that before?) Once known as Red Raptor, I'm now Black Harrier, one of the world's most famous masked crime-fighters. And I’m trying to help stop the end of the world.</p> <p><b><i>Invasion </i></b><b>is the third book in the new Harrier series from Audible number one best-selling author Jaime Castle and CJ Valin, the creators of Raptors.</b></p>";
