window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There are no heroes in Wichita…</b></p> <p>The heroes Terry Fairway once idolized have turned against him, hunting him down at every turn. His grandfather, the ruthless S-ranked necromancer who rules the city, watches from his throne as the people starve and suffer. Vampires stalk the streets unchecked, feeding on the innocent without fear of reprisal.</p> <p>Terry always believed his family were the good guys, but Wichita isn't a city of heroes or villains—it's a city of power. And if power is all that matters, then power is what Terry will seize.</p> <p>He’ll become powerful enough to drive the vampires from the shadows. Powerful enough to feed the hungry and defend the downtrodden. Powerful enough to challenge his grandfather and bring hope to a city drowning in darkness.</p> <p>Because even in the deepest black, a single light can spark a revolution. And Terry's ready to burn bright.</p> <p>Or burn it all to the ground trying.</p>";
