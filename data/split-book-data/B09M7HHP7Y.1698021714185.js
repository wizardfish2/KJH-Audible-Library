window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Warner spent his days like no one else.</p> <p>He got up, went to work, forced people to balance their scales - either through taking lives or forced penance - went home, spent time with his daughter, slept with one of his girlfriends, and went to sleep.</p> <p>Only to repeat the pattern over and over and over.</p> <p>Life was the furthest thing from mundane that it could ever be.</p> <p>Warner’s life had changed when his daughter had been nearly fatally injured, plunging Warner into a world of paranormal creatures, monsters, and magic that he’d never known existed.</p> <p>Then he came out the other side as the arbiter of Retribution. He now personally hands out justice to any and all he comes across.</p> <p>Warner has been using his powers considerably since then. Cutting down all who would stand before him and attempt to stop him in his personal crusade.</p> <p>The price he is forced to pay for such power is catching up to him. Catching up to him and forcing him to pay...with interest.</p> <p>Spending more of his time sick and wretched after overuse of the power, he must now begin to wonder about the balance in his own life.</p> <p>Each time he finds himself throwing up golden vomit that turns to blood, he has to wonder just how much damage he is causing to his own body.</p> <p>Except a great change in the world is coming. One that will force a reckoning no one wishes, with Warner becoming a massive lightning rod for it.</p> <p>The very world trembles with the actions he’s taken, and quails in fright at what he must do next.</p> <p>Warning and minor spoiler: This novel contains graphic violence, undefined relationships/harem, unconventional opinions/beliefs, and a hero who is as tactful as a dog at a cat show. Listen at your own risk.</p>";
