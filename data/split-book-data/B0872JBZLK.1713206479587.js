window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The lands to the South are full of depraved women driven mad by forbidden sorcery. Now that sounds like fun for a barbarian from the Black Wolf Clan.</b></p> <p>The barbarians of the frozen north live to fight, drink, hunt, and screw, and Ymir is a true son of the Ax Tundra, until a demon curses him with magic. Orphaned by battle and banished by his tribe, Ymir heads south to Old Ironbound, a university where the rich and well-connected learn to master magic. Will Ymir’s traditions and pride lead him to failure? Or will the centuries of knowledge — and the lusty human, elven, orcish, and dwarven noblewomen — give him limitless power?</p> <p>Either way, while his days are all about studying and scheming, his nights are filled with wild sex in the beds of beautiful women. Because in the lands of the South, there are few men, and those Southern women have needs.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer: </b><b><i>Barbarian Outcast</i></b><b> is a steamy slice-of-life harem adventure in a magic university on another world. The sex scenes are explicit but don’t get in the way of the story as it slowly unfolds. Enter a brand-new world from Aaron Crash, the best-selling author of the American Dragon series.</b></p>";
