window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Being both a witch and a werewolf might not be enough....</b></p> <p>My name's Tamara Bentley and lately everything I touch turns to crap. My best friend is missing, I was forced to kill my favorite aunt...oh, and my parents have been kidnapped by the queen of the fairies. It's enough to give a person a complex.</p> <p>There's no time to drown my sorrows, though. I've got two warring factions to contend with. Neither the witches nor the werewolves like me, much less respect me, but somehow I need to rally them to my cause if I'm to have any chance of rescuing my parents.</p> <p>And that might be the least of my worries. A dark force has been unleashed and it's dead set on introducing me to a whole new world of hurt. I'll have to dig deeper than I ever have before to stop its plans, save my parents, and face off against a freaking goddess. No pressure there, right?</p>";
