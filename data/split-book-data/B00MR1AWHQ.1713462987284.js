window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Albert Johannson's forgotten more than he remembers about his past, but two things he's sure of: He's lived a long, long time, and he doesn't trust anyone, particularly gods. He's not too fond of demons either, particularly the one that shows up in his kitchen looking for help with a supernatural investigation. Albert's a strangely gifted blacksmith, not a P.I., but crossing a demon can be deadly, so he reluctantly takes the job - which puts him in the path of a prickly arson detective named Melissa el Hajj who has trust issues of her own. Clashing at a crime scene, they uncover an ancient wrought-iron hexagram, a broken relic as old as Solomon. The thing may herald catastrophe unless Albert can mend it - but Albert has yet to grasp just what his special powers really mean....</p>";
