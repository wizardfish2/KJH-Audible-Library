window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Jack Atlas: twice as cocky, insufferable, and neck-deep in the Tower—AKA the divine death trap.</b><br> <br> Stuck in a dungeon meticulously designed to ruin their lives in the most entertaining way possible, Jack and his best friend, Hannah, are outnumbered and outmatched by monsters with questionable ethics. Jack knows he should be fighting for his life, but where’s the fun in that? Instead, he’s decided to charm the dungeon’s nastiest creatures, turning enemies into reluctant allies, and allies… let’s just say things get complicated.<br> <br> A civil war is raging outside the dungeon, where things have gone from bad, to ‘the world’s literally on fire’. On one side is his ex-mentor, Rodeo—a guy who makes violating the Geneva Conventions look like a hobby. On the other, his ‘we’re totally over but let’s not rule out hate-flirting’ ex, Sarah, who’s leading the good guys with the moral superiority of a saint and the firepower of a dragon.<br> <br> Jack’s got a simple plan. Escape the dungeon, avoid getting eaten, or betrayed—or both—figure out whether Sarah wants to kill him or kiss him, and just maybe land a solid punch on Rodeo’s smug face. All before happy hour, because, priorities.</p>";
