Reality is Coming Undone, and Only I Can Stop it.</b></p> <p>I’ve come far in my quest against the Saints and Republic, gathering power allies and the firepower of the greatest starship built by humanity. Only… it might not be enough. The Saints have ripped a hole in reality, one that will allow their eldritch masters to enter our world and consume it whole.</p> <p>Leading humanity’s crusade against the apocalypse, my lovers and I will need to smash through the Saints' defenses and reach the corrupt capital of the Republic. If we can slay our foes before the breach fully opens, we might have a chance of stopping them. But millions of raving madmen, xeno-tainted horrors, and dark, twisted secrets lay between us and our goal.</p> <p>The Star Ravagers will finally have their revenge, but will there be a galaxy left in the wake of our victory?</p>";
