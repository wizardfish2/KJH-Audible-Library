So, when I finally saved enough, I purchased the most rundown manor I could find to scratch the itch.</p> <p>The problem? A few guests rest within its walls who pique my interest in the most delightful ways.</p> <p>And who are these new roommates? A sweet garden nymph, a mischievous dullahan, and a mysterious goth demon. Turns out, the house isn’t the only thing in need of a helping hand.</p> <p>But no quest is without its prize. I never imagined that buying a rundown mansion would grant me powers! The more I repair, the more the house rewards me. It started as strength and endurance, but the closer I get to the girls, the more magical I become.</p> <p>And my efforts to fix the house haven’t gone unnoticed. When the HOA shows up, I think they’re about to congratulate me on all my hard work.</p> <p>Instead, they gave me a to-do list a mile long.</p> <p>And we’re not the only paranormals in this so-called normal suburb.</p> <p>Repairing the mansion is the challenge I craved, but a string of vandalisms keeps us on edge. Someone, or something, doesn’t want us living here.</p> <p>It turns out Sunnyside won’t be as peaceful as I expected.</p>";
