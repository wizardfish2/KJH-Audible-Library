The Preacher-Warlord gathers his and the Sanctum's might.

Giovanni Marcos, the ex-mob enforcer, pushes to save another who he's been told will tip the scales and lead the Temple. The contest for Supremacy will be brutal.<br> <br> The Multi-Versal System's murderous intent is front and center as alwaysâ€”only in conflict and blood shall the feast be joined....<br> <br> Gideon, L'Sana, Princess Arizelle, and the Legendary Personal Assistant AI, Frederick the First, must face all adversaries if they are to reach the top of the heap.</p>";
