Simultaneously, the world's Monsters are growing more powerful, and he's on the brink of discovering unsettling knowledge. This compels him to reconsider his abilities. Fortunately, he doesn't have to deal with the Ulliam Fruit, except for the remnants still scattered around. Rand hopes these remnants are rare or non-existent.</p> <p>During his tenure at SA, he learns that not all Superheroes are bad people; although, the majority are. With assistance from his contacts within, Jim and Mike, Rand uncovers concealed information that SA kept from world governments. Now, with support from Linda and later Sue, his objective is to establish global stability. However, despite Lilamiatomo's assurance that external threats to Earth are not a concern, the monster problem escalates beyond initial estimations.</p> <p>Embark on a journey with Rand and his companions as they engage in a race to determine the victor: humanity or the monsters.</p>";
