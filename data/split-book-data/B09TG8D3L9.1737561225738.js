window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Home of Consequence</i> is the third book in a series that continues the tale of Nameless and his bond-mates as they return home and try to resume their lives while grappling with loss. All while knowing that a dark threat still looms. </p> <p>Warning: This is a work of erotic fantasy. There is nudity, swearing, a fair bit of violence, and plenty of naughty sex between man (and woman) and monster girl/girls. If that isn’t your cup of tea, please give this book a pass! </p> <p>Otherwise, please enjoy!</p>";
