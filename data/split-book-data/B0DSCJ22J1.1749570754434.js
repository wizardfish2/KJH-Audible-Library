window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Brian and his companions are embarking on an unusual journey to a scarcely-visited realm, a place most would avoid unless they were demons: the Nine Hells. But this isn’t a leisurely vacation; it’s a daring rescue mission.</p> <p>The question looms: why does Lucifer desire Inonia’s father? Is it merely to thwart Brian, as many suspect?</p> <p>Yet, a puzzling dilemma remains. Why does Lucifer fear Brian? True, Brian is the first Dragon to emerge in eons, but is that reason enough for Lucifer to attempt to hinder, capture, or even annihilate him? While Brian is convinced that Inonia’s father needs saving, a nagging feeling suggests otherwise–a trap tailored specifically for him.</p> <p>Guided by Galdot, Brian ventures into the treacherous Nine Hells, and the plot takes a thrilling turn. Can Brian prevent Lucifer from harming Inonia’s father? More importantly, can a freshly born Dragon defeat a Fallen Angel with an ageless history? Join Brian and his comrades on a journey filled with unexpected adventures to find out.</p>";
