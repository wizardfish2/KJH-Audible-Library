But fate has a twisted sense of humour: instead of being sentenced to eternal oblivion, SJ's reborn in Amathera—a vibrant fantasy landscape full of magic, monsters, and a game-like System that <i>really</i> wishes she hadn't read the fine print.</p> <p>Armed with her sassy and overly sarcastic AI companion, Dave, and the <i>questionable</i> skills of a fae assassin, SJ is thrust into this mystical new world. But there's one problem: she never agreed to the terms and conditions, and now she's the one person operating completely free of the System's rules. Drawing the attention of local gods, dragons, and everything in between, she's destined to become an Amatherean celebrity.</p> <p>With oddities such as high-level enemies and unique gear drops at every turn, finding her footing will be no easy task in this place where reputation matters. SJ will need Dave's guidance if she wants to level up and survive the challenges thrown her way. Only then can she help the inhabitants of her quaint starter town of Killic and begin to uncover the complex mysteries of Amathera.</p> <p>And as outside pressures mount, SJ's starting to realize her death was only the <i>first</i> glitch in the System . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 500,000 views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
