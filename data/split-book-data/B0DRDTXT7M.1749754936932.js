window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>GAME ON!</p> <p>Ever since the signing of the World War III Armistice, the virtual world has become even more important than the real world. Adam does not care for the virtual world. His only concern is curing his terminally ill lover, but with Aris on the verge of death, he is running out of both time and hope.</p> <p>When a woman called Fayte comes knocking on his door with a proposal, he’s all too happy to accommodate her. She will cure Aris of her supposedly incurable disease with experimental technology that may have dark ties to Adam’s past. In exchange, Adam will enter the newest VRMMORPG, Age of Gods, to help Fayte win a bet that will have dire consequences for her should she lose. He enters the game, creates his character, and is ready to rock.</p> <p>But before he can even think of helping Fayte, he must first leave the Village of Beginnings by reaching level 10. Can Adam prove his worth by being the first person to complete the dreaded tutorial stage?</p>";
