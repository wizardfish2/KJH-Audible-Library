window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ripped from a dead-end life and plunged into a world where danger lurks behind every smile, Xiulan must learn to thrive in a realm ruled by ruthless ambition and deadly secrets.</p> <p>When Li Mei dies in a traffic accident after another soul-crushing retail shift, she awakens in a familiar yet dangerous world: inside her favorite game, Phoenix Kingdom Chronicles. Now inhabiting the body of Lin Xiulan, the scorned second daughter of a noble family, she finds herself thrust into a nest of vipers where her very existence is an offense to those around her.</p> <p>Armed only with her knowledge of the game and the wounds from a lifetime of dealing with entitled customers, Xiulan refuses to play the role of the family’s punching bag. Determined to rise above, she must master immortal alchemy, tame arcane spirit beasts, perfect her martial arts, and face off against her scheming sisters and stepmother.</p> <p>In the Kingdom, power means everything. Weakness invites destruction, and Xiulan must do more than simply survive and fade into the background.</p> <p>With the knowledge of a devastating future that awaits the realm’s beloved Crown Princess, she’ll need every ounce of her modern wit and growing abilities to prevent a catastrophe that would ruin the entire realm. All assuming she can survive her own family long enough to do anything about it.</p> <p>Only by transforming herself can Xiulan hope to protect those she comes to care about.</p>";
