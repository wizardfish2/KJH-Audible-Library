The lost evergreen valley, surrounded by snowy mountain peaks, is a very tempting prize that immediately attracted the envious attention of all the neighbors.<br> <br> And that means the time has come for Sergeant and his cat Whiskers to demonstrate the skills and spells they've learned in this new world, dust off their concealed artifacts, and make use of the beasts they tamed at the beginning of the game in order to withstand a siege, fight off vicious attacks, and defend their independence and their lives.<br> <br> Their enemies are powerful, and they're also numerous. Very numerous. But as strange as it might sound, that's actually a good thing—there's no unity among their opponents, which means that the League of Losers might just have a chance not only to survive, but to become more powerful and reach for new heights!</p>";
