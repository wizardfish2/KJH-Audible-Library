But every section he fixes will help him turn the tide.</p> <p>Jasper Cloud has been torn from a dystopian Earth and thrust into a mighty but ruined alien starship, where deranged and mutated creatures haunt the darkened corridors. They’ve consumed all but one crewmember: the being serving as the ship’s core, a young woman as badly damaged as the starship itself.</p> <p>They both should be as doomed as Jasper was back on Earth, but for one surprise: Jasper has the power to help repair the damaged sections of the mighty vessel.</p> <p>And every section he repairs also augments his own body.</p> <p>If he is quiet and careful, he can turn himself into a weapon capable of defeating the hungry horrors still prowling the ship’s halls, and reactivate the most powerful spacecraft left in the universe.</p> <p>But if he fails, then the creatures will have a vessel of their own to visit and devour every populated planet left - Earth included.</p> <p><i>Cradle</i> meets <i>Dead Space</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
