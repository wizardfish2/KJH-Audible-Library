Before Pack's body is cold, he faces resistance from the Chosen and needs to find those he can trust among the conquered masses. Balancing expectations while charting a new path for all Therians is more difficult than he expected.</p> <p>It's a good thing he's up for the challenge, but as Grave, there is more than Therians on his mind. The Feds are still after him, and Ranger is relentless. As tough as it is having the strongest Neohuman in the world after him, the Federal Response Teams aren't the only external threats he faces. Gangs of humans and Neohumans alike threaten his newfound territory, and the beast Pack awakened inside him will not tolerate it. Plus, he needs to figure out how to launder the fifty million dollars he stole.</p> <p>There is no rest for the wicked. He must deal with all the new threats or lose everything he's gained. Thankfully, he's got a superpowered blonde, a mad scientist, a ghost-girl, and a magic ninja to help.</p>";
