As we grappled with the aftermath of the first integration, a new, more daunting phase began. The System had unveiled additional shards, each a victorious fragment of a broken civilization, survivors and conquerors just like us. These battle-hardened and desperate people are determined to win, and pose a threat unlike any we've faced so far.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the lifeline between Crownhill and Themyscira hangs in the balance. Elder Thalassa still holds a grudge against me, and without her mother, Cyra won't have the sway to keep her at bay. If my shops in Shadefall are discovered, the flow of goods between Earth and Themyscira will surely be cut off, along with my hopes for victory on Earth.</p> <p>Every battle I've endured, and every lover I've gained, has led me to this moment. To face these new threats, I'll be counting on Bridget, Sakura, and Myrina more than ever. Now, the fate of two realms rests on our shoulders.</p>";
