Now I’m Lord Nathan Cavendish, young, titled, and carrying the potential to become something more.</p> <p>In this world, every winter brings monstrous hordes. Magic exists, but it's weak and unreliable. The exception? Wild Sorceresses, women overflowing with raw power so vast they’re feared and hunted. Not by me. I see potential in them, and I have the means to harness it.</p> <p>I have the MageMark System, a mysterious force that urges me to bond with mages and unlock their true potential. When I heard about a sorceress imprisoned in a distant village, I knew it was my chance.</p> <p>Now I have to win over a hostile town, outmaneuver the empire, and survive long enough to reshape this broken world. The odds are stacked against me, but I’ve got magic, ambition, and a second chance I won’t waste.</p>";
