window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The future has amazing technology. Our alien allies have magic. Together, we are building a training system to teach the best of humanity to go to the stars. But the training is monumentally expensive. Stephanie Morgana is a genius, she just doesn't know it. Join her on the first half of her adventure with this collected edition, including the first three megabooks in the Federal Histories series.</p> <p>Book One: The Artificial Intelligence that runs the Virtual World is charged with testing Stephanie, a task it has never performed before. Will Stephanie pass the test and be moved to the advanced preparatory schools, or will the system miss her? Will the AI be able to judge a human's potential in an area where it has no existing test data to compare?</p> <p>Book Two: The Artificial Intelligence that runs the Virtual World has decided it needs to break a few rules in order to follow its prime directives. Can it help Stephanie acquire her skills quickly enough to help defend against an evil already heading toward the Federation?</p> <p>Book Three: Stephanie Morgana has graduated to Protector of ALL Federation’s people. But can she get them to all respect her? She has to go to Dreth and find out. To pass a test, there is one more type of MU she has to understand, without killing herself in the process.</p>";
