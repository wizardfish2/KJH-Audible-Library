window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Control the mines, win a war, get a ship... and fight back.</p> <p>Time is ticking down in the Empire’s game, and Alan has only five months to establish dominance in all three Metal mines... one of which is controlled by the enemy nation of Britonia. After a daring rescue mission exposes Britonia’s endless supply of high-tech weapons, Alan must now devise a way to beat their superior firepower using his biggest advantage: the bond he shares with his dinosaurs.</p> <p>To better understand the bond, Alan earns the trust of Lindiwe, his beautiful-and-buff general. Her secrets change everything, and together, Alan believes they can capture one mine, find another, and steal the last mine from a defeated Britonia... all before time runs out. However, making the Top Ten is just the beginning for Tribe Grant. To truly win, he will have to strike at the real enemy: the Empire itself.</p> <p>But the Empire isn’t going down easy, and they’ve got one final trick up their sleeve.</p>";
