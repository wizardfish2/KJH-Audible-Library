But fate has other plans when his diplomatic mission takes him to the orc homeworld to meet the Blackgorge Tribe.</p> <p>The Ten Thousand Worlds is a bigger place than Theo could have imagined. He must strengthen his clan and himself if he is to prepare for these new challenges. Before, the princess saved the Hearthwood Clan.
