Wrong.</i></b><br> <br> King Arthur's sitting on the British throne, but not everyone's buying the whole “Once and Future King\" schtick. Apparently, what he needs to shut up the doubters is the Dark Blade. You know, the one. Massive sword which is oddly stuck in a rock, guarded by a soggy woman handing out weaponry like it’s the prize in a raffle. (Seriously, who came up with this system?)<br> <br> Enter me—baby Cultivator, reluctant hero, and professional screw-up. Now I’m stuck leading yet another merry band of misfits, this time into the Land of the Fae. Spoiler: it’s less \"fairy tale\" and more \"acid trip with a murder problem.\" The locals don’t like us, the rules of reality are up for debate, and the sword? Let’s just say it's playing hard to get.<br> <br> <b><i>Between Fae politics, magical prophecies, and Merlin's ghost reminding me how much more work I have to do before I’m actually any good at this, this is quite the road trip.</i></b></p>";
