window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Eldritch Blackwood Jr. never quite fit the mold of a proper necromancer.</b><br> <br> Instead of raising armies of the dead, he specializes in bringing beloved pets back to life. But when Eld’s prestigious family forces him to enroll at Bathurst Academy of Post-Mortem Studies, his unlife takes an unexpected turn. Between dodging his father’s ever-growing expectations and navigating the bizarre social landscape of underworld academia, Eld stumbles upon something far more terrifying than final exams—a buried girl in the academy’s graveyard.<br> <br> But Lea isn’t just another restless spirit. She’s an eldritch entity whose missing memories hide apocalyptic secrets. Can Eld and his misfit crew of nightkin companions unravel the mysteries of Bathurst all while finding dates to Necropromicon?</p> <p><b>A stitched-up amalgamation of cozy fantasy and comedic horror, Love, Death, and Other Awkward Spells is about how it’s never too late to find purpose—even if you’re buried six feet under.</b></p>";
