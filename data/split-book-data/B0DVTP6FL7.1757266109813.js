He is immediately forced to tackle a Delve set to the highest difficulty with a party of adventurers who are not only strangers to him, but strangers to each other as well.<br> <br> Arlo has no armor, no weapons, no knowledge of the world at large, and his party is growing increasingly suspicious of his lack of preparation and paper-thin excuses for how he got there.</p> <p>There's also the fact that the System in charge seems to be treating Arlo's situation like a big, cosmic joke.</p> <p>Determined not to die <i>again</i>, Arlo forgoes putting any points into his highest stat, Intelligence, and instead dumps everything he's got into Fortitude.
