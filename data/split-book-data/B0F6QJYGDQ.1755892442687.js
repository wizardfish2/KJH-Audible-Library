His first order of business is to cleanse his farm of bad actors, after which he must uncover the treasure left to him by the murdered Lord Minax. This hunt leads Warren to the frigid north, where a beautiful enemy guards a power that only Warren can unlock.</p> <p>However, gaining new power—and new partners—has its costs, and the war has accelerated rapidly in Warren’s absence. To defeat King Kurto before his own people are killed, Warren must forge alliances with all of the Four Demons and seize the crown for his old friend Fieran... but Fieran might want more than a crown. She might be after his heart, too.</p>";
