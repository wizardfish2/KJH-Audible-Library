window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I'm being hunted by mages and might get evicted soon. Things are actually looking up for me!</b></p> <p>A lot has changed since I turned twenty-three and gained access to the Halls of Magic. Back then, I was stuck in a dead-end job, plagued by a metabolic disorder destined to put me in an early grave. Since accessing the Halls of Magic, I've discovered a cure for my condition, but only if I can unlock all five Aspects of magic.</p> <p>Armed with a spellbook straight out of an RPG, a sarcastic feline familiar, and the adoration of two beautiful Aspects—who are still learning how to be human—I feel unstoppable. But the Halls aren’t as empty as we had thought. Really weird mages have claimed the wreckage of the Halls, and they’ve marked me as public enemy number one.</p> <p>Between problems at my job, eviction threats from my landlord, and a lovecraftian horror who wants to dissect me, I really have my hands full. It's time to go on the offensive. It's time for War.</p> <p>Welcome back to the Halls of Magic. It's fireball time, baby.</p>";
