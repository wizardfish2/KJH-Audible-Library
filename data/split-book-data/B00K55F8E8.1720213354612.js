window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of Heinlein's best-loved works, <i>The Rolling Stones </i>follows the rollicking adventures of the Stone family as they tour the solar system. </p> <p>It doesn't seem likely for twins to have the same middle name. Even so, it's clear that Castor and Pollux Stone both have \"Trouble\" written in that spot on their birth certificates. Of course, anyone who's met their grandmother Hazel would know they came by it honestly. </p> <p>Join the Stone twins as they connive, cajole, and bamboozle their way across the solar system in the company of the most high-spirited and hilarious family in all of science fiction.... It all starts when the twins decide that life on the lunar colony is too dull and buy their own spaceship to go into business for themselves. Before long they are headed for the furthest reaches of the stars, with stops on Mars, some asteroids, Titan, and beyond. </p> <p>This lighthearted tale has some of Heinlein's sassiest dialogue - not to mention the famous flat cats incident. Oddly enough, it's also a true example of real family values, for when you're a Stone, your family is your highest priority.</p>";
