window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Jiran's rapid ascensions through the tiers have been nought but meteoric. His growth beyond the norm. But he has only begun to understand the intricate gifts he’s earned, and he is out of time. The empire is out of time. A reckoning is coming, and they are not prepared.</b></p> <p>The Graymin rulers have taken notice of Jiran’s unusual powers, and their greed knows no bounds. Unfortunately, divination of those beyond one’s tier is a known impossibility, and so the empire is unaware of the tide of destruction poised to wash it away.</p> <p>Oblivious to the looming danger, Jiran has set upon an adventure in a new land. With Mayalyn and Niya at his side, the trio must unravel the mysteries of a unique and enchanting race, because beneath their exotic beauty, resides a secret that could save everything they hold dear.</p> <p>Behind the curtains, an enemy hides in the empire’s shadow, prepared to strike when all hope seems lost. Meanwhile, Madra’s manipulations continue to unfold; her will unbending as the seasons that scour her surface.</p> <p>But within every tragedy, there lies a ray of hope, within every misfortune a path to power, and within every being that inhabits the planet stuck on hard mode rests the chance for greatness.</p> <p>With new powers and allies, Jiran has the pieces needed to save his home, his people. All he has to do is put them together before it's too late.</p> <p><b>If only it were that simple.</b></p>";
