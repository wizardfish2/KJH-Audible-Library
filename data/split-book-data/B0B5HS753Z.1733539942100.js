window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Have you ever had a bad day? Sergeant Paul Mitchell had. It was the kind of bad day where nothing went right, everything that could go wrong went wrong, and everyone died. </b></p> <p>He knew that was always a possibility in the marines, but it really sucked when it happened to you: it wasn't your fault, and you still took the fall for everything.</p> <p>With his career dead and buried, he's forced to make it as a freelancer; a jack of all trades but a master of none. Just when he thought life couldn't get any worse a couple of stupid kids proved him wrong...again. Now, the ex-marine needs to find a ship, a crew who won't ask too many questions, get off-world, and disappear into the black. Too bad the women he's signed on with have a few secrets of their own.</p> <p><i>Life of a Freelancer </i>contains graphic sexual situations, bad language, intense violence, and a guy doing what he has to in order to survive. You've been warned.</p>";
