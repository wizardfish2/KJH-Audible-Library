window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Out here, power is key. Getting it, using it, keeping it. Without power, you’re nothing but fertilizer.”</p> <p>Two months ago, Clay Jaeger, his wife Alex, and his chainsaw-toting brother Joe came to the Infested Zone on a mission: kill a Dungeon Lord. What they found along the way was a land of opportunity. Gold-dropping monsters, magical weapons, and best of all, freedom—all there for the taking.</p> <p>If they can live long enough to grab it.</p> <p>Surviving in the wasteland has been a constant fight, but thriving in it, that’s going to take something more. Not just power, but the brains to use it in ways nobody’s seen before.</p> <p>When a deposed Dungeon Lord sends them on a once-in-a-lifetime quest, Clay sees the chance to turn that power to his family’s advantage. But what on the surface looks like the Jaeger clan’s ultimate opportunity might actually be the meat grinder that gets them all killed. Especially if the overpowered Incant who’s been chasing them has anything to say about it.</p>";
