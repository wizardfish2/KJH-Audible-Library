His blood unleashed.</b></p> <p>No matter which way Danzen Ravja turns, someone wants to kill him or exploit his demonic powers.

But disappearing isn't going to be as easy as it seems.</p> <p>With new foes around every corner, Danzen will be forced to his limits unless he learns how to control his demons, and this isn't to mention the sudden appearance of his father, the ruler of Diyu, of Hell itself, who has warmed to the idea of Danzen taking his throne.</p> <p>Pilgrim is a xianxia cultivation series inspired by the Witcher books, John Wick films, the Inuyasha anime, the Preacher comics, and the movie <i>Yojimbo</i>.</p>";
