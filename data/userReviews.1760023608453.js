My Audible library had over 1,700 books, but I still come back to this series at least once every few months.<br><br>The characters are fully dimensional, with very unique personalities and interactions. I think the thing that keeps me coming back is that while each character has power, they all also have flaws. The are no Mary Sue's here. But together, this new family is a powerhouse force to be reckoned with. <br><br>I keep hoping that the author comes back to this series soon, and continues the story. <br><br>The voice actors are awesome. The narration of Sam, especially some of his inner monolog moments, make him real. The female voices are all unique and absolutely perfect. Rose is adorable, and Eden makes me want to smile so hard it hurts. </p>","title":"My favorite series, bar none."},{"asin":"1774248182","ratings":[{"name":"Overall","stars":"5"},{"name":"Performance","stars":"5"},{"name":"Story","stars":"5"}],"summary":"<p> I finally took the chance after reading all the good reviews, and I'm glad I did.
